Das Häuschen verfügt über eine vollumfänglich ausgestattete Küche, herrlich zum selber kochen. Alles war sehr sauber und mit Liebe hergerichtet. Anna haben wir nicht getroffen aber ihre Familie war sehr freundlich und herzlich. Eine Umgebung zum entspannen."
432044,91823080,2017-04-30T07:27:26Z,C'est parfait
432044,11398879,2017-04-20T12:37:17Z,"It was the picture if this trullo that made me want to come to Puglia to start with! A really unique, cosy and beautiful place to stay - comfortable bed, well equipped kitchen, and Anna had kindly left us some eggs and water and jam, which was lovely. Sitting out in the little private courtyard, sipping coffee, admiring the view and deciding where to visit was bliss. The location was great (though you will need Anna's instructions to find it the first time!), lovely and peaceful, and really easy to get to nearby Cisternino, Locorotondo, Castellana for the caves, and of course, Alberobello. 
A wonderful stay in a beautiful piece of Puglian history."
432044,74578137,2017-04-18T12:55:35Z,"We had an amazing experience staying at this gorgeous trullo. It is truly a work of art and we were able to relax and enjoy the beautiful cities around. I would recommend to rent a car since the trullis are a bit secluded with beautiful nature around them, and there are a lot of cities around that should be explored. And Anna is one of the rare super hosts you can find on airbnb, and with a person like that its guaranteed to have a great time. Communication was perfect and she was really helpful when ever we needed assistance, we even managed to see some hidden gems in town thanks to her. Was a pleasure and hope we can stay with her again!"
432044,1178038,2017-04-15T08:51:50Z,We had a great stay in Anna's Trullo.  The neighbouring countryside is delightful. We rode bikes around the neighbouring areas and explored the countryside dotted with cute Trullo houses. It's a very magical area. You do need a car. We had planned to explore the east coast towns but ended up staying around the house as it was so wonderful and relaxing.  Thanks Anna and family! 
432044,22657868,2017-04-08T08:25:43Z,"We stayed here for 5 nights during the first week of April. Really amazing setting in the countryside and great for children. My daughter loved the two friendly horses and was out every morning to feed them. The location is perfect for exploring the region, right in the middle of everything. Most of the interesting sights are within 30-45mins by car and the drives through the countryside are beautiful. Mama Tonia welcomed us when we arrived, and we managed to understand everything despite our English/Italian being just as bad as each other's (zero). She gave us fresh eggs from her hens and some delicious homemade jam (I didn't get what fruit it was...a late autumnal fruit a bit smaller than an orange...anyway it was yummy). The basics were provided, coffee, stuff for cooking etc. There's a good supermarket not far where we got everything else we needed. The nearest Town of Cisternino has a nice centre and the highlight for us was a little local pizzeria where a pretty big pizza cost 4-5 euros  on the main high street just before the road bends downhill near the ""Centro Storico"". 
The only minus was that the wifi wasn't working while we were there, because of a technical fault in the area. And the walls of the trullo are pretty thick so not much 3G signal when we got inside. Anna did make every effort to get this resolved though. Despite this we had a really good stay and would definitely recommend "
432044,1503610,2017-03-28T06:07:09Z,"A wonderful place to relax... The trullo itself is very charming and the surrounding areas offer both beautiful landscapes and interesting historic villages to explore (Locorotondo was our favourite). Anna and her parents ensured that we had everything we needed - from fresh eggs and home-made jam to organic olive oil. They are very warm and pleasant people, and we enjoyed talking with them. We highly recommend this place and are already planning our next visit!"
432044,91623286,2017-03-20T07:06:13Z,"This is a very special place. Great accommodation, great hospitality and in beautiful country. Visitors need to allow plenty of time to explore this fascinating region. And, if you can, to take a lesson in cooking the cuisine of Puglia!"
432044,39532637,2017-03-11T07:17:58Z,We had a really pleasent stay at i sette coni. Anna and her family were gorgeous hosts and make you feel really welcome. The trullo does really look like on the pictures and even better (something not usual nowadays). The trullo is located in a beautiful (i guess) typical apulian country-side but this also means you'll definately need a car to travel around. The trullo is a great place to relax and calm down. We totally recommend i sette coni and would be pleased if we find time to return for another stay in the future.
432044,1628656,2017-03-04T09:54:13Z,A wonderful house in a beautiful location. House comes well equipped and Anna is a delightful host. Highest recommendation. 
432044,117319012,2017-02-26T08:12:00Z,"All was great. Really cozy, secluded, but a close drive to all. "
432044,12395790,2017-02-19T07:57:51Z,"We loved our stay at Anna's trullo, and wish we had scheduled more time there as two nights was not enough. Anna and her mother were friendly and helpful at check-in, and the snacks left for us were much appreciated. The kitchen was well-equipped so we were able to do some cooking. It was a perfect home base from which to explore the other towns and sights in Puglia."
432044,14691453,2017-02-17T09:06:08Z,Great place. Great location. Great host.
432044,25901815,2017-01-05T09:37:09Z,"Anna's Trulli was lovely, it is surrounded by fields and olive groves. There is a lovely sunny terrace and an outdoor oven (which we didn't use because of the time of year!). Anna was very friendly and there was milk, coffee and breakfast food for our arrival. Latter during our sstay her mother very kindly brought us some more delicious homemade jam and a basket of freshly laid eggs. The heating was on for our arrival and we had a fire in the evenings so it was very cosy.  We would really recommend staying at Anna's. "
432044,6547457,2016-12-30T10:51:12Z,Delightful home & picturesque countryside! We had a wonderful time and would absolutely return. Anna and her family were wonderful. Anna was also great about communicating promptly & making sure our needs were met. 
432044,47662959,2016-12-25T08:05:44Z,Anna is a very friendly and helpful host... will definitely stay again
432044,967647,2016-11-16T08:26:00Z,"Beautiful quiet countryside setting in a lovely and well maintained trulli in a perfect location to explore Loccorotondo, Martina Franca, Cisternino and Alberobello! Very photogenic & clean accomodation with a wood fire place, gas top stove/oven, comfortable bed and everything you need to cook yourselves if you wish.. highly recommended to ask for Anna's sister Veronica, if available, to run a cooking lesson (she's a trained chef).  If you do, have it on your first night's stay as you'll likely have leftovers! We stayed for 3 nights in November cooking/reading/relaxing but could have stayed 5.  Best AirBnB experience we've had.. Anna and Veronica were lovely.."
432044,78419141,2016-11-01T09:34:43Z,"
We really loved our stay in the Trullo. What we especially loved, was the authenticity of the house and it's surroundings. But also it's great to experience the hospitality, attention and warmness of Anna and of the whole family Zizzi.
The house was nicely pre-heated on our relatively cold late arrival. Fortunately there were basic supplies. The location of the Trullo is perfect for visiting cities and beach.
The nearby located Osteria Sant' Anna proved to be a very good recommendation from Anna!
This Trullo is a very nice and safe place, with very nice people!"
432044,7942156,2016-10-24T04:33:53Z,"Our stay at the trullo was one of the main highlights of our trip to Italy. The pictures looked amazing but we were blown away when we actually saw the place and the surrounding area in person! We had an incredible first evening by taking a cooking class with Anna's sister Veronica which was such a great experience and we had enough food to last us the whole stay! The location of the trullo was very ideal, close to Cisternino, Locorotondo and Martina Franca. We were also easily able to do day trips to Polignano a Mare and Lecce. If you're looking for a unique stay, centrally located in Puglia and a once in a lifetime experience this is the place! We can't wait to return in the future!"
432044,10475951,2016-10-21T09:27:27Z,"My girlfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here, Anna was a lovely host with quick response time, and very helpful. Her mothers' home made cherry jam was delicious!! Would recommend this place to anybody who wants to see the beautiful south east of Italy. "
530250,23266141,2017-04-29T14:18:53Z,Casa Caracol is a true gem. We had a wonderful week on the island thanks to Vane and Raquel's hospitality! I would go back here in a heartbeat.
530250,62365234,2017-04-21T15:03:41Z,A great place to stay/ close to great food and places to see - we were not able to use the pool for the first few days of our stay as they have placed chemicals in the pool which was disappointing
530250,2292192,2017-04-17T15:10:46Z,"Gorgeously handcrafted home created in the imagination and brought to life by two artistic brothers. The location is great to get the best local beaches for snorkelling, some good restaurants only 5 minutes walk away and only 18 minute walk from Punta Sur. We were pampered with white wine for our one year anniversary, allowed to check in a bit early, indulged in the beauty of the place and enjoyed every minute with Raquel and her wonderful family. The best stay on the Isla!"
530250,109640963,2017-04-05T13:46:13Z,Unreal. There is no reason to ever leave . I've asked my host to sell it to me. Love loved it.
530250,40623188,2017-04-03T05:13:25Z,This place is everything and more. We had a few small bumps in the road and the hosts were more than helpful. This place is incredible. If it's not on the top of your bucket list .. it needs to be. I will be back one day!
530250,44434958,2017-03-17T13:40:04Z,Beautifull relaxing house at a beautifull island. Golfcart is really needed but Vanessa arranged that for us  Really great
530250,8695733,2017-03-16T03:47:17Z,"We loved staying at Casa Caracol.  The hosts Vanessa and her mother were very helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.  She picked us up at the ferry, had snacks in the fridge for us, quickly answered any e-mails I sent before coming and arranged a go cart rental for us.  
The house is quiet and comfortable.  With the go cart it is a short drive from anywhere on the island.  "
530250,22644409,2017-03-12T07:07:32Z,"Cet endroit est d(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)nnnnngue.......! On se sent vraiment dans un lieu original, différent et à la fois fonctionnel et très agréable pour passer de superbes vacances. Le prix est très correct par rapport à la prestation magnifique et unique de la casa caracol..! Pour en rajouter un peu, Raquel et Michelle sont adorables, très chaleureuses et peuvent vous conseiller pour les bons resto, les supermarché de l'île, etc... Aucun point négatif ! C'est insolite, nous avons adoré ces 3 jours passés à isla Mujeres !!! "
530250,110143701,2017-03-08T14:42:41Z,"Muy linda la zona y la casa, diferente a todo, muy atenta la atención por parte de la dueña con buen recibimiento. "
530250,1017269,2017-03-06T15:31:41Z,"The shell house has been on my wishlist for 3 years, and I was excited to finally stay here.  Vanessa greeted us like family and drove us to pick up our golf cart.  
Everything was amazing and I want to go back!"
530250,48617147,2017-02-22T01:03:57Z,"To put it simply: this house is a work of art that you can live in. It is truly unique/one-of-a-kind house. Inside has a Capadoccia cave dwelling feel, outside reminds( but does not resemble) white houses of Santornini. But, truly, in defies categorization. This is the one you have to see for yourself to appreciate fully. "
530250,10605762,2017-02-11T13:48:21Z,"Really amazing home, it's rather famous for the island and everyone stops to take pictures of it! You'll want a golf cart booked because it's on other side of island. Family was extremely helpful when my friend got sick and even brought over medicine for him.

You'll be happy to book this place, waking up each morning is like a Dr. Seuss dream. 

Slight issue on checkin with golf cart rental, make sure you call the number and speak personally with the owner as that person does not check Airbnb and my emails to her never arrived. "
530250,39303303,2017-02-02T04:37:54Z,"Incredibly fantastic house! If you are going to Mexico, I recommend Cancun; in Cancun, I recommend Island Mujeres; in Mujeres I recommand the SHELL HOUSE! As the host said, everyone knows it on the island. The house is especially suitable for families with children, or small group within 4~5. and the host are living close to you, warmly helpful for everything you need!"
530250,73798057,2017-01-26T13:56:59Z,The shell house is everything they say and more. What it lacks in amenity it more makes up in style and class.  Amazing designer. Great pool. Wonderful artwork. Enjoyed the house for my birthday party and it was like a dream come true. Should be on your bucket list!
530250,107557725,2017-01-21T14:26:28Z,"Noise street, construction on property, limited hot water and tourists taking pictures.  On the other hand, it's one of those places you just have to stay at once."
530250,41263503,2017-01-08T16:24:34Z,The seashell house is absolutely beautiful and unique. We loved this relaxing and private getaway. We also really appreciated Vanessa picking us up for a golf cart rental and the great suggestions for breakfast and dinner. Would highly recommend!
530250,38439281,2017-01-07T04:04:36Z,Staying in this property is a unique experience and Vanessa who met us on arrival was so incredibly helpful and welcoming.  We really loved staying here and on the island. The property is in need of a little tlc in some places but overall these small things do not detract from being in such a special house on a fun island. 
530250,2887434,2017-01-03T14:12:05Z,"Wonderful stay, felt like a mermaid with all the shell details around the house. It looks exactly like the pictures! Equipped with TV, wifi and air conditioning, couldn't have asked for more. Just a short golf cart ride to amazing restaurants and the beach, location is perfect. Would definitely stay here again and hope to soon :) Vaenessa and her mother were extremely accommodating and so so helpful with everything from great food recommendations to transportation around the island. They arranged for pick up for us at the dock, golf cart rental, as well as a taxi drop off at 5am because we had a very early flight back in Cancun! Such unique experience, grateful for our visit and to the family who built this amazing place. Thank you!"
530250,2169890,2016-12-27T13:14:21Z,"An unforgettable, unique and beautiful space!  We loved every minute at the Shell House.  Michelle's communication was great and Vanessa was super helpful picking us up at the ferry and arranging for a golf cart for us.  If you are looking for someplace special, different, creative and fun...look no further!"
530250,69653656,2016-12-22T05:00:10Z,"The Shell House was exactly what we wanted, needed and more. The only reason we came to Isla Mujeres is because of this house. Every time we told some one where were we're staying, they would say ""ohhhh wow! We love that house!"" The host Vanessa and her mother were MORE than gracious, they made us feel right at home, helped us with golf carts, where to eat and shop and even cut down some coconuts from the tree to drink/eat right there! The house was perfect and the town is our new favorite get away. We will definitely be back! Sooner than later!"
1415908,31817490,2017-05-07T14:30:48Z,"How do I put into words what kind of experience this place is - one of a kind masterpiece. This by far has been the most enjoyable trip I have had. The serenity, peacefulness and coziness of this treehouse exceeded the high expectations i had going into it. And Peter...the best host and guy you can imagine. This is not just a treehouse, it literally is a sanctuary. So much character, personality and art captivates it. And I know you might not believe it...but not a concern in the world about mosquitoes or being bit - it's like an invisible mosquito net surrounds the treehouse. Not every person may get to experience the beauty this place holds, but those who do understand the lasting impression it leaves. Thank you Peter for everything - we loved you!! "
1415908,61676161,2017-04-29T12:24:12Z,"Staying in the treehouse was the most memorable and serene experiences we've ever had. Every detail adds to the experience; waking up under the trees to the bird singing, the bridges, the lights, the stream, all the little treasures in the tree houses, Peter's coffee, and the comfort of the bed and hammock. Do your mind, body, and soul a favor and book it! 

Dinner recs: Antico, Le Fat"
1415908,18766582,2017-04-23T12:52:06Z,"There are truly no words that can even begin to describe the magic of this place, but here I try! The second we set foot on the first stair of the treehouse it felt as if time had completely stopped and we were enveloped in tranquility and relaxation. When sipping our morning tea and coffee on the balcony of the treehouse was more incredible and breathtaking than sipping our coffee on the balcony in Paris, you KNOW you have found a true gem! One unlike any other! You feels as though you are worlds away, but you can get in your car and be in the city in just a couple of minutes! Peter was the most gracious and welcoming host I have ever encountered, and you can tell his passion lies within making sure his guests are pleased to the fullest extent! From the STUNNING fresh flowers he places throughout the treehouse to the welcome basket of delicious snacks and wine, to the hot coffee and tea in the morning; I'm not sure how we even managed to leave! This place is the epitome of serenity and the only thing we regret is not staying longer! We already miss The Old Man (a 167 year old pine tree) and Daisy and Haskell! Who am I kidding we miss every square foot of this place and we can't wait to return! Don't keep scrolling, BOOK IT NOW!!! I PROMISE you will not regret it and you will forever get to cherish the memory of the vacation of your life!"
1415908,51512979,2017-04-16T14:59:14Z,"Truly a one of a kind experience! The tree house is amazing and so well-constructed. It's hard to leave, but if you do, you're incredibly close to downtown and all the fun of Atlanta. "
1415908,61322420,2017-04-13T14:44:36Z,One of my favorite trips of all time.  Everything exceeded my expectations!  Highly recommend this experience.  
1415908,108441134,2017-04-06T15:09:51Z,"Narnia is the best was to describe this place for us. We drove through everything familiar to us and with the ride down a driveway, were taken to another place completely. We were welcomed and given a brief tour, then were left to enjoy the retreat. It was peaceful and comforting even during the wrath of Mother Nature pounding down on it. The fresh flowers, welcome basket of wine and snacks, birds singing, antique decor, perfectly placed lighting, heated bed, cool breeze, rope bridges and fresh air all made for a perfectly relaxing environment to zone out and smile. Thank you for sharing this place with us. You are making the world a better place two guests at a time."
1415908,94078325,2017-04-03T15:06:44Z,"Wow! I saw a few years back a few friends of mine had visited the treehouse and then posted the experience to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)- immediately interested I went to air bnb to get in on the action- however this unique spot was booked solid for at least a year. 

Recently around Christmas time I saw some availability for April and immediately booked. Upon arriving you are driving through any regular suburban style neighborhood so you think,"" this isn't the right place."" As soon as you pull down the driveway you are immediately taken to another place. Spiritually, and physically- it just is an out of this world experience. Peter asked a few times if I was okay because you are so taken back by what your seeing (but not in a bad way!) 

The treehouses felt fresh, and clean and were filled with wine, snacks and fresh flowers. For a chilly night the bed warms up! Every particular detail was though of and it was transparent to me that Peter just wanted to create the best experience possible for whoever is staying. 


I have nothing bad to say about my experience other then I wish I stayed longer. Until next time! 
"
1415908,43036298,2017-04-02T12:38:16Z,Pictures don't do this place justice. What an amazing place and even more amazing time. Peter was a great host and the treehouse could not be more impressive. 
1415908,69701621,2017-03-30T15:52:13Z,Amazing! We watched fireflies before drifting off to sleep. This is a must stay. 
1415908,56766675,2017-03-26T12:53:42Z,"Absolutely magical! Secluded, private and relaxing right in the middle of the city, it could not have been more perfect! Peter was the perfect host and full of interesting stories as well as great recommendations for places to visit."
1415908,11277168,2017-03-22T12:40:13Z,"We had the most magical couple of days staying in Peter and Katies treehouse.  As stunning as the pictures are none can truly capture the phenomenal essence of this place and its impact on your soul.  

In addition to be warmly greeted and looked after by Peter, we were treated to a lovely food and wine hamper. Our first night was spent with the bed rolled out under the stars, which was a truly refreshing experience. The second night we were lucky enough to snuggle up as a thunderstorm rattled outside, it was divine.  

Peter was a wonderful host. Him and Katie have created an adult wonderland in their backyard. Should we ever be in Atlanta again we will be stopping by for another visit! "
1415908,19515466,2017-03-19T15:36:06Z,"The treehouse was amazing. Truly an unforgettable experience. Peter was very friendly and welcoming. The furnishings, art, and scenic experience were all amazing, as was the proximity of this secluded space to the rest of Atlanta. It is truly a treehouse, so keep that in mind when booking during chilly days, but the heated mattress was amazing!"
1415908,93530271,2017-03-12T12:33:39Z,"Peter's hospitality was unparalleled! Highly recommend for those looking for a quiet, quaint, and private get-a-way!"
1415908,425909,2016-11-25T14:35:59Z,Beautiful. Met all expectations. Peter was a wonderful host. Highly recommend!
1415908,54119997,2016-11-14T00:21:05Z,"This was absolutely the most amazing experience I have ever had! Peter went above and beyond in ensuring our stay exceeded expectations. He and daisy gave us a warm welcome and gave us a tour of the tree houses. Every morning we woke up to birds chirping, coffee awaiting, and spent the day mesmerized by all the tree houses had to offer. The decor is incredible, the details are magnificent, and Peter was the perfect host. it was the most magical way to celebrate our 5th anniversary- we will definitely  be back!"
1415908,4367331,2016-11-07T01:28:15Z,"It's hard to not sound completely hyperbolic and ridiculous describing this place, but it's truly wonderful. My wife and I celebrating our five-year anniversary here, and we could not recommend it more. Such a fantastic, relaxing place (I seriously haven't slept this great in months), a short drive from most of intown Atlanta. We'll be back."
1415908,95567279,2016-11-04T15:50:02Z,"This was a truly magical treehouse. It was beautiful. The attention to detail was amazing. And the coffee and tea were delicious. It was exactly what we needed.... despite only living 15 minutes away, it felt like we were in another world. And Peter and Katie's restaurant recommendations were great... we decided to only go to places we hadn't been before and Le Fat and Hankook Taqueria were both excellent. I'm hoping we can make this a yearly thing. Definitely plan on coming back. "
1415908,34422864,2016-10-30T01:15:55Z,Simply magical! Open to the environment & yet not so much. My husband and I had a wonderful time away from it all. We enjoyed the beauty of the whimsical treehouses' while listening to the sounds of the squirrels having fun throughout the woods below. Their cat Haskell is my favorite; quite a charmer that one. I would love to come back one day! The food choices Katie & Peter shared with us were spot in perfect too. What a treat for us. ❤️️
1415908,38099158,2016-10-22T02:46:53Z,The 
1415908,64932752,2016-10-19T12:41:28Z,Peter and Katie's treehouse is absolutely perfect. We couldn't have imagined how beautiful it is in person and how relaxed you feel from the moment you arrive. Peter couldn't have done enough for us and makes the most delicious coffee in the morning. Looking forward to our return trip already. 
3406062,76155363,2017-04-28T23:04:25Z,"Amazing location, views, & scenery"
3406062,126924253,2017-04-24T22:14:04Z,"Simply magical. Born in LA and grew up in Malibu and still have never experienced anything like this. The adventure to get there, the nap outside under the sun listening the great music system... Cooking, super comfy bed, blanket of stars, a little slice of heaven perfect for a special occasion. Refreshing to have no wife and no one else in sight. Loved it. Bring water and snacks Xo"
3406062,126840107,2017-04-23T21:54:20Z,"This is place is absolutely stunning.  If you want to get away and unwind, I highly recommend going here.  "
3406062,29575768,2017-04-20T16:29:49Z,The place was excellent but the owners was rude
3406062,14249515,2017-04-17T15:42:11Z,"I would recommend this Airstream due to the astonishing view. There is not compared to spend the afternoon on the balcony staring at the sea and sunset. 
The access is hard but Rani has given details that made it  much easier. 
There is no wifi in the place and cellphone reception is very poor, so keep in mind that you will probably be unplugged to the world the days you spend in the airstream. "
3406062,112420491,2017-04-15T16:12:27Z,This place is a true gem and a huge experience. I would definently recommend giving yourself an opportunity to see and experience this unique place. Rani was a great host all along in the process.
3406062,26881614,2017-04-13T17:09:14Z,Best Airbnb I have ever stayed. Period. 
3406062,75323121,2017-04-12T16:53:21Z,Not worth missing. 
3406062,11663996,2017-04-09T18:59:35Z,"Views are amazing. Airstream has everything you need to camp including stove, fridge and toilet. No cell service so download a playlist and enjoy the seclusion. Would recommend bringing your own drinking water and some coffee grounds for the French press. You won't want to make the drive twice so bring all you food and supplies initially. The wind was very strong so we spent most of the night inside but the glass doors allow the wonderful views from anywhere in the airstream.  Like others have said this is camping not a luxury hotel. There are bugs and critters but the experience is something we won't forget. A great getaway from the city. Highly recommended! "
3406062,87421088,2017-04-07T15:16:33Z,"This place is absolutely incredible!!!  View and experience are both unparalleled.  Christian is very accommodating and fast to reply to any concerns.   A couple of notes to future guests:  (1) There are bugs - lots of them.  This is glamping, not the four seasons.  If you aren't comfortable with that, then this is not the place for you.  If you can get past that (bug repellant and candles help a lot), this will be an incredible experience.  (2)  It gets very cold at night (we visited in the April months), so would recommend bringing warm clothes and a couple of extra blankets.  (3)  There are actually 2 paths to get to the top.  We travelled both.  One is significantly more bumpy and ""off-road"" than the other.  While we could have made it no problem with our mid-size Sedan, we elected to rent a compact SUV which made it much easier to get to the top in comfort.  (4)  Water in the airstream is questionable, so be sure to bring lots of water for yourself and for cooking.  Other than that, this is unquestionably a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience.  You are actually situated above the fog later and in some cases the cloud line!!  I'm missing it already and will definitely be back.  Thank you Christian for making this opportunity available to others."
3406062,31021771,2017-04-05T18:05:20Z,"I really couldn't begin to do this place justice, but I will say I really loved most everything about it. The panoramic views are simply stunning- truly the mount Olympus of Malibu. The airstream perches on the top of the mountain and is all at once charming, modern, and rustic. I felt comfortable and at home immediately.  It's clear that whomever designed this place loved it.  Aesthetics and functionality are well balanced, and touches of quirkiness and humor abound.
That said, I do believe that there's room for improvement.  Especially at this price point.  The road is pretty intense, for instance, but could be a lot less stressful if it was grated regularly. Also a Water filter/ice tray would be a great addition. What really kept coming up for me was just a feeling of neglect. Almost like the person who had made this place so special had departed, and no one had though to maintain or improve what had been created.  I know it sounds harsh, but I kept seeing missed potential everywhere I looked, and for $600.00 a night, I don't think it's too much to ask for the details to be right.  "
3406062,6486902,2017-04-03T15:57:55Z,"Beyond my expectations! No words to describe , a surreal Paradise! 
If you need some quiet and peace in your life that is the place to go. Meraviglioso! "
3406062,13926082,2017-04-02T15:50:42Z,This is as amazing as the pictures make it look! Maybe even more! Such a great spot!
3406062,27184901,2017-04-01T16:38:04Z,This listing has everything as stated in the description. It is an absolutely beautiful secluded gem in Malibu. I went here for my birthday and it was the best decision! Breathtaking the entire time. Would highly recommend to stay here :) 
3406062,42948142,2017-03-30T18:37:07Z,"The views here are unbelievable and worth every dollar!  Spending hours soaking in the sunset and sunrise on top of a quiet mountain in Malibu overlooking the Pacific was such a special experience that my girlfriend and I will remember forever.  The road up there was a little difficult for my Nissan Altima (bottomed out about 5x each way), but again, worth it.  The outlets in the airstream didn't work and the sink water smelled funky, so it felt like a camping (glamping) experience, which as a big camping fan, I was totally fine with.  The sinks by the bathroom worked though.  The airstream is equipped with a functioning refrigerator, freezer, stove, and also had all the kitchenware you would need, including a wine opener ;)  If you don't want to do dishes though, bring paper/plastic supplies. Anyway, you should definitely stay here!"
3406062,29067311,2017-03-29T15:46:51Z,The Malibu airstream was truly a slice of heaven on earth.  A sanctuary above all the fray.  We are so grateful for having had the opportunity to stay.  Beautifully appointed with all the essentials.   We hope to come back again soon.
3406062,30512235,2017-03-28T16:53:57Z,"Absolutely perfect! What a majestic retreat up in the mountain! The little last 0.75 miles up the dirt road is a little intimidating if you are a city slicker, but definitely do-able and you'll conquer the fear fairly quickly. It is an airstream dream come true! "
3406062,21178631,2017-03-21T15:20:06Z,"Incredible place, the setting and view are out of this world. Nothing better than staying in an airstream to get away from the world. "
3406062,486331,2017-03-19T15:56:21Z,"The views are just unbelievable, and the bed and outdoor seating area are both lovely and very comfortable. We slept great and had a blast. We went over St. Patrick's Day weekend and both days the weather turned out perfect and the sunsets were unreal. The location, privacy, silence, and natural beauty are unsurpassed. Nice to have a working toilet, shower, and sinks too. Do take note of the House Manual, however, since you won't have cell service at the airstream (bucket under the sink!). We followed recommendations from other guests and brought a big queen-sized comforter and were VERY glad we did - quite cold at night! It also gets quite hot there during the day, so it pays to get out and about. We hiked Sandstone Peak (~30 min drive) and hiked up behind the airstream and both were beautiful and had stunning views (watch for rattlesnakes!). Definitely a rough-ish drive up to the airstream, so recommend high-clearance vehicle as well. Also, the fridge/freezer doesn't work very well and the water is slightly questionable, so don't forget to stop on the PCH first for plenty of water and ice. Also, there are no power outlets (either that or we weren't able to make the solar-powered battery outside work) so come prepared with batteries and charger packs. So romantic, we absolutely loved our ""glamping"" weekend!!! Thank you!"
3406062,25550909,2017-03-13T18:43:52Z,I highly recommend this experience. The view is spectacular. Sunset & sunrise was off the charts wonderful. 
798483,47681238,2017-04-13T02:40:52Z,"This is the most amazing place I ever visited in the world, so far, and I am a very frequent traveler. We rented the whole place for us, yet... That says it all. The view is incredible, having a hot tub in the forest at night with fireflies unbelievable. The swimmingpool is private and the showers huge. The people are extremely helpful and I wish I can come back soon. Unbelievable. "
798483,19696456,2017-04-06T00:49:18Z,"stay  here and and an experience of a lifetime. We are blown away everything about the kind of living. It's other worldly, our kids were amazed, it really is an education for them. It's jungle living with 5 star care. The food the Ketut made from her amazing kitchen is incredible. She always mad the kids less spicy, the Indonesian food is authentic and delicious. (She can also make tasty western burgers and chips if kids need some comfort. We were so well looked after and the house was immaculate, and we came back to clean sheets every day. Wildlife is about you, but the geckos are there to look after all the insects. We didn't see any spiders, just bats and lizards. We were taken to the temples on a special day and Ketut came with some traditional costumes for us all to wear. Honestly I have travelled the world and stayed in some incredible places but this place is by far the best experience of my travels. One piece of advise is to bring ear plugs as the river and the jungle lifer can be loud sometimes. It's magical though!!!"
798483,119009704,2017-03-21T00:35:51Z,Everyone should sleep at least once in a house like this...a perfect dream (URL HIDDEN) it if you can.
798483,94618184,2017-03-12T01:55:27Z,"The view from the house was like a movie avatar world, it was a another world. We were deeply moved and I wanted to live forever. Wild monkeys and flocks of colorful birds flew close up and it was a wonderful place than I thought. The bamboo floor was very comfortable and the interior was very unique.
The staff are very kind and correspond quickly and accurately.
However, it is a bit far from sightseeing spots, and the driver is not so familiar with each area, so it is better to check the complete address of the destination. And it is better to ask the office staff in advance to find places on the web."
798483,16946579,2017-02-24T00:40:42Z,"Such an amazing place! Speechless and overwhelmed! Super value. Superfast correspondence. Massive, spectacular house! Sooooo beautiful"
798483,47147433,2017-02-12T02:36:10Z,Sunrise House is an amazing place to stay if you love the jungle! 
798483,3679933,2017-01-18T01:12:30Z,"This is such a special and unique place to stay - it had been a dream of mine for many years, and I am so grateful that it finally came true :)

We felt so looked after the second we pulled into the parking lot, greeted by wonderful staff and people to help with luggage - we didn't lift a finger!

The house itself was breathtaking, spotlessly clean with fresh flowers on every surface, the fruit basket piled high, and a fridge stocked with drinks. The beds were incredibly comfy with soft sheets and clean mosquito nets (a rare thing in Bali!). 

The restaurant nearby served delicious food at reasonable prices, and it could be brought right to the house, which was wonderful when it was raining! 

If you're looking for a very quiet, serene place to chill out for a few days, this is it! "
798483,81606478,2017-01-06T01:09:43Z,"Amazing once in a lifetime experience staying in this unique home. It was absolutely stunning. We greatly enjoyed our two night stay. I highly recommend the property. Do be aware that the house is indeed one with nature meaning that bugs, butterflys, birds, and lizards will also be your fellow guests! The masterbedroom had an AC unit under the bug net which made sleeping quite comfortable. "
798483,24697397,2017-01-01T01:33:33Z,"This is a once in a lifetime type of lodging. My wife I have traveled to 40+ cohntries together and have never stayed in anything like this. Open layout top floor is just stunning. Anybody into architecture must see this place. Staff is amazing as is the food, can't thank Yustina and Mirna enough and all the staff we encountered, mucb more like a hotel, meals delivered to your home and housekeeping. Fair warning though, there is not a single window in the home, so nature may come with the territory. There are curtains around the beds so u can sleep inside in safety from bugs/birds should they bother u, and ac in the one bedroom on the bottom floor (where we slept). I would imagine it may get a bit hot in the others. But this shouldn't put u off, this place is ridiculous and def worth a couple nights, bring your gopro/super wide angle camera and your videos will make prove it... we would love to come back in the future! Thanks for all"
798483,68795029,2016-12-23T02:06:30Z,"Our family of 4 from HK was seeking an exceptional, natural, unplugged holiday during Xmas & the Green Village definitely offered us more than what we expected!

The Sunrise House is a fantastic architecture and a perfect home away from home for us to wind down, read, write & enjoy intimate moments with our kids. We never had such a large lodging for holidays and best was the rent!

What exceeded most our expectation was the friendliness of all the staff there. Special thanks to Yusiana (our Villa Manager), Mirna & our driver Budi! First, I found my passport lost right after I checked in the Village and it was Mirna who kept being very positive & helpful in calming me down & checking things for me. Next day Yusiana & Budi drove me to the airport where they made some arrangement and got me back in the security checkpoint where I forgot to take my passport! I can't express more my thankfulness to them, not to mention the courtesy that they didn't charge me this transportation!

Throughout our stay we felt we were so nicely taken care of! Mirna even spent hours to help my girl untangled her hair that was stuck in a comb; and Yusiana kept trying to secure tours for us at different other places (Green School, John Hardy Jewellery Factory) where we felt we got extra privilege only cos we were guests from the Green Village (private tour by the best guides - same fee!)

Back to the house. The 1-foot long gekko, bugs and moths actually didn't 'bug' us a lot as we chose to experience this windowless bamboo house. It could have been better only if their breakfast can be improved...actually the first dinner there was delicious but the breakfast was a bit substandard (scramble eggs were tasteless and there's no option of fried eggs; pancake & french toast were rock hard). We did buy bread for ourselves (there's toaster) but once we finished it isn't on the menu (so we were basically fixing cereal & fruit everyday).

I understand that not everyone can tolerate a windowless, air-con-less lodging in a warm place like Bali, but this experience definitely was one of the most memorable (and best) we had! We actually felt grateful that it didn't take long for all 4 of us to adjust to a '100% natural' setting, that we came to live with the insects as a visitor, and adapt to their habitat in the most stylish, luxurious way!

We'd love to come back again, probably for summer Green Camps! Thank you once again for your hospitality!"
798483,40943120,2016-12-05T03:13:55Z,"This stunning mansion blew me away! I planned a surprise for the person I was traveling with and was surprise myself! The space was gorgeous and unlike any architecture I've ever seen. My favorite was the television nook since it was the perfect little space that was a bit more closed off from the other open parts of the space. But the whole place felt so luxurious, yet unique. I definitely wish we stayed longer! 

Open air naturally called for a good number of passing by insects and animals (cats!). The worst was flying insects right around sunset, but that's to be expected. Just be aware if you're booking. 

The customer service was amazing with our host assisting us with every need we had, including planning meals and a driver to and from our other locations. 

I wish I had looked more into the tour of the Green School. For some reason, I was under assumption that we would just be able to walk there and tour ourselves, but that's certainly not the case! Take advantage ahead of time! But we were still able to venture the neighborhood surrounding and the river/jungle area which made for a relaxing getaway. Highly recommended!"
798483,33536213,2016-10-27T08:03:52Z,"It was an amazing stay for my whole family (children ranging from 2 -10 y.o.). A truly unique experience as we have never stayed anywhere quite like it. You do feel like you are in this amazing jungle tree house overlooking the vast tropical rain forest. Everything is indeed very open including the bathroom facilities. So be prepared for some openness amongst the people staying in the house. Since there are no sealed walls, you expect there to be a variety of bug life that come in, especially at night when you have the lights on. But they are not a nuisance at any point. There are heavy duty insect netting around all the beds giving you a very cosy bubble to be in. The mosquitos were not as prevalent as we would have expected, maybe because the house is quite elevated. The generous airflow also means we are just comfortable, and was never in need for air con. Although the river flowing noise is quite loud at nights, it is actually quite relaxing. The place is in it's own guarded development, as it is quite remote. The staff on sight were all super friendly and super helpful. So thanks. We chose to stay here specifically to enjoy the house (& the village), and also to visit the Green School and Bamboo factory. So a perfect for what we were looking for."
798483,3570823,2016-10-15T00:03:16Z,Wow! This place is truly phenomenal. Easily one of the most interesting and unique structure I've slept in. I'd recommend staying here.
798483,21587127,2016-10-10T00:40:14Z,"Mirna is such a nice, friendly person. We had a warm welcoming when we arrived at the Bamboo house. In the Bamboo house a big fresh fruit bowl was served every day. If you want to do any activity Mirna organize everything for you."
798483,53968580,2016-09-30T05:10:05Z,"Waauw wat een uniek verblijf!
Zon zien opkomen alleen al...
Ideaal om tot rust te komen!"
798483,30774884,2016-09-16T03:26:22Z,Green Village is out of this world. I could not have dreamt up a better start to my honeymoon.  Thank you!!
798483,45673047,2016-09-13T02:02:06Z,"This place is one of a kind. It's very secluded, quiet and relaxing. Upon arrival, the management team arranged transportation from the airport to the Green Village which was quite appreciated as the place is hard to find.

We were taken away by the architecture of the house and the whole village as well. Almost every bit is made out of bamboo. 

Since it's situated in the middle of a forest, we saw few unharmful insects and birds inside, but this was expected and we did not mind it. They seem to go back to the forest after midnight.

Staying in Green Village was defiantly the highlight of our Indonesia trip. It's not a mere accommodation, but a unique experience that I will definitely repeat if I go to Bali again. Highly recommended.

Be sure to confirm pricing of any other services in advance to avoid surprise hefty bills at the end. Location is not close to public transit however and the driver recommended is very expensive. "

I loved the atmosphere there and I loved the sound of birds when you wake up and you realise you are in the middle of the nature. Yudy, the host is so much helpful. I loved her breakfasts and she is very reliable! Many thanks to Hernando for taking us everywhere we wished by his car. Thanks to him we could visit the places around. If you wish to relax and detach from busy life, this is the perfect place! The shower is spectacular, outdoor, among bananas trees!! This place is just worth to visit even for a short stay!!

Localizada en un lugar increíble, con mucha flora y fauna y rodeada de cultivos. Lo único es que me imaginé que iba estar un poco más aislada o separada de la casa de la finca."
3993887,50162719,2016-10-21T14:11:14Z,"Yudy and her family where incredible hosts and so kind. This cabana was so perfect for a relaxing time and the location could not be better. There are so many activities that are a close bus ride away to the neighboring towns and Yudy was able to organize/give us specific instructions on how to go about doing what we wanted. From start to finish this cabana lived up to the pictures, if not better, the outdoor shower is to die for and everything was very clean and orderly. Their neighbor, Hernando came to pick us up at the airport and was available to take us where we needed to go. Yudy also is an incredible cook, should you choose to stay here, you get home cooking too!! What could be better. If you are you are looking at listing here, don't look any further!!

It is very private, it has a relaxing feel, and the outdoor shower/bathroom added a fun touch to the overall experience. The hosts are very easy to get in touch with and Yudy was very kind to stay up to ensure we made it to the finca (we didn't get in until about 10pm). The finca itself is georgeous!! After a delicious breakfast, we enjoyed the hammocks, walked to the creek, watched the different birds, before leaving to explore  the coffee region. It was a great experience where we got to disconnect and enjoy nature!! "

Not far off the main road, you are conveniently close to everything, yet still feel tucked away under the vast desert sky.

They are communicative, gracious and extremely thoughtful hosts. "

--exploring the national park, which is only a 10-min drive away 
--exploring the cute boutiques and restaurants in downtown, which is practically walking distance from the house

We ran out of time for the hot tub under the stars, board games and a trip to Pappy & Harriet's, but we will surely be back. 

Thank you Sara & Rich for an unforgettable experience!"
32694,52644941,2017-04-17T15:40:49Z,The house is small and very close to the highway. It's obviously famous on instagram and the owners are super nice people. But it isn't cheap and for the same money you can get A LOT cooler houses in JT. 
32694,40542424,2017-04-14T17:44:17Z,"The Joshua Tree House was amazing! Sara & Rich thought of every detail when designing it. We particularly loved the record player and record collection.  We enjoyed the tunes with a cup of Joshua Tree Coffee each morning. The bed was also extremely comfortable - we'll be looking into Casper for our next mattress. 

Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would recommend to anyone. We hope to come back in the future! "
32694,22556009,2017-04-12T18:23:19Z,everything is good!
32694,62469144,2017-04-10T09:40:09Z,"Had a wonderful weekend filled with desert magic at The Joshua Tree House, check in/out was easy thanks to their beautiful illustrated guide to the house & JT. Enjoyed beautiful views from the porch and delicious locally roasted coffee. Great place to get away and do as much or as little as you'd like. Thanks Sarah & Rich!"
32694,56345650,2017-04-07T15:44:29Z,"The Joshua Tree House was a really fun place to stay. It was thoughtfully decorated, beds and pillows are comfortable, great location and beautiful property. The only very minor downside was the very small kitchen and no BBQ. But those things were easily worked around and did nothing to dissuade us from visiting again!!! Really loved it!"
32694,36824413,2017-04-04T17:44:57Z,"This place is so special.  Not only comfortable, but so beautifully designed that it felt like home, but better than home.  This is our second stay and we will absolutely be back.  Thanks Sara and Rich!"
32694,35161621,2017-04-03T18:20:13Z,"Honestly, a magical and gorgeous place to get away from it all! We had an incredible time and would go back in a heartbeat. In fact, we plan to!

"
32694,27154967,2017-04-01T18:43:43Z,Unique southwest experience. Impeccable authentic cowboy decor. Perfect in every way.
32694,52110607,2017-04-01T01:46:08Z,The house is walking distance from town with the most amazing sunsets and sunrises seen from the front and back porch. Excellent hosts and the perfect getaway spot for exploring Joshua Tree National Park!
32694,45839224,2017-03-25T15:41:42Z,Awesome experience! Would highly recommend staying here. The pictures of the place don't do it justice and Sara and Rich we're great hosts.
32694,23004819,2017-03-19T15:16:33Z,This is a one-of-a-kind place! Beautiful and clean accommodations - excellent communication from the owners. We had a wonderful time and would highly recommend it to others. 
32694,24174292,2017-03-18T08:58:30Z,Amazing setting. Beautiful place. Great location. Definitely as advertised. Our stay was too short - we could easily have stayed much longer. Great place for relaxing around the house and also good for checking out all the incredible stuff in the area. The attention to detail makes the house really special. Magical!
32694,92281462,2017-03-15T18:28:43Z,"Lovely house, very comfortable, close to restaurants and Joshua Tree National Park.  Enjoyed our stay very much. "
1720832,13969070,2017-05-11T17:56:48Z,"The pictures of the cottage aren't beautiful, but it's even more beautiful in real life. A perfect getaway!"
1720832,65508195,2017-05-07T16:21:18Z,"Alexis & Manny's cob house is amazing! We were greeted by fresh eggs, milk, and banana bread. The cabin is so cozy, and having a fire inside as it cools down outside in a room full of cool old books and pillow-covered seats makes it even cozier. It's felt so quiet and secluded, yet centrally located on the island - and there's nothing like falling asleep to the sound of frogs, hanging out with friendly chickens, and sitting outside by the warm cob oven! Such an amazing getaway."
1720832,11584698,2017-05-05T18:56:49Z,"This was a fantastic Airbnb experience! We chose Alexis' place as an opportunity to try out cob living, we highly recommend it. The hospitality we received was warm and welcoming. The hidden gem of the trip was Mayne Island itself! We truly loved it - and can attest that with walking and the car stop system - the islands features can be accessible without a car. "
1720832,12434231,2017-05-02T18:58:25Z,This place is described exactly as it is. Alexis is a great host. Will definitely come back to visit. We felt like home. Highly recommended cottage. 5 star
1720832,5705859,2017-04-30T15:47:18Z,My wife and I had a wonderful weekend getaway at this lovely little cottage. Highly recommend!
1720832,50538922,2017-04-27T17:35:43Z,"If for some reason you're on the fence--just book it. Hands down better than any other place you could end up staying on Mayne Island. Lots of opportunities to see whales coming through the pass, great hiking views, and a cozy space to relax at the end of your adventures. Say hi to the sheep while you're there!"
1720832,7412755,2017-04-23T18:45:52Z,"We have rented the cob cottage as a surprise for my daughter an her family, Alexis was super esay to communicate before hand and really helpful. Here is a note from my daughter on her stay at the cob cottage : ""We had the most resourcing and magical time at the cob cottage. Alexis and family are helpful, easy to communicate with and really welcoming. We spend some time together learning about the island, very interesting. Fresh eggs, milk, homemade banana loaf and granola were awaiting us, delicious and the best attention. Beautiful toys for our little boy has been brought to the cottage as well. The cottage is a home away from home, a space wher you fell good instantly. Would definitely recommend it and come back !"". Catherine from france and her daughter'family, Alix, Adrien et Titouan from Vancouver."
1720832,85326609,2017-04-21T18:56:36Z,A beautiful home with great privacy and ammenities. Fantastic introduction to Cobb!
1720832,6315937,2017-04-19T15:45:25Z,"Everything as described. Only surprise was fresh farm eggs, milk and loaf. "
1720832,32548635,2017-04-17T17:11:05Z,I can't think of anyone who would not really enjoy this place. Anyone.
1720832,57115181,2017-04-13T16:23:50Z,"This place is magical and Alexis and Manny are terrifically courteous, helpful, and generous hosts. It was so much fun to have the goats and chickens visit--they are adorable but not omnipresent or annoying. We loved our stay and would definitely come here again. A peaceful and serene retreat with lots of privacy--basically Alexis and Manny were available when we needed them but otherwise we felt pleasantly alone. Definitely recommend. "
1720832,37491387,2017-04-09T16:53:31Z,"The cob cottage on Alexis and Manny's little corner of Mayne Island embodies romanticism of returning to nature. From the chickens that greet you in the morning to the symphony of frogs at night, from cooking fresh farm eggs in the morning to cozying up by the traditional fireplace at night brings you closer to feeling balance in your soul."
1720832,72490257,2017-04-03T04:26:18Z,"A little slice of heaven! Once you are through the gates, you start to relax.. the warm welcome, the opportunity to interact with the friendly farm animals, all the personal homey touches in the cob cottage, the beautiful indoor and outdoor fireplaces not to mention the large canvas of stars .... a perfect place to unwind, rebalance and reconnect. Thanks again Alexis and Manny."
1720832,66833057,2017-03-29T19:00:12Z,"This is probably the cutest place we could have stayed.  It was a perfect getaway for a couple.  We spent most of our time in the Cob house, because it was so neat.  The owners have some very friendly chickens and sheep that liked to come to the door for a visit."
1720832,161149,2017-03-27T16:51:36Z,"Cob Cottage is a truly special place! Unique, private, well equipped and utterly charming. We loved our long weekend away, and enjoyed interacting with the farm animals each day. Thank you Alexis for your attention to detail and great communication! "
1720832,26155569,2017-03-15T16:51:37Z,"An excellent experience. This is a location I will return to. Whilst I did not see my host after initial check in, the friendly sheep and chickens did stop by to pay their respects and pose for photos. The freshly baked nut loaf, goat's milk and free range chicken eggs were well appreciated. I highly recommend staying at this very unique abode."
1720832,38684435,2017-03-14T02:47:46Z,"My fiance and I stayed here for a fews days and it was nothing short of magical! 

Both Alexis and Manny went out of their way to help us with our stay from picking us up from the ferry port and dropping us off at the end of our stay. Fantastic warm hosts.

On arrival we found fresh banana bread, milk and eggs. The house has everything you need and more. It is extremely cosy very clean and well presented throughout.

The added bonus of feeding the sheep treats was amazing, we also saw a fair few deer around the house too.

I'd highly recommend staying at the cob house it was a fantastic experience and we hope to return again. "
1720832,103708641,2017-03-10T18:22:24Z,"This magical little cottage is a destination onto itself. Cozy and comfortable and so beautiful, thoughtfully built. We were so inspired by the beautiful craftsmanship and design that went into the cottage, and of course the surrounding landscape. Alexis is so gracious and left us some delicious eggs from her hens and a lovely loaf that was super handy to have. Totally recommend this little corner of the world for a visit and can't wait to go back with my family. "
1720832,85953657,2017-03-08T18:06:29Z,"A truly magical experience. As part of our exploration in natural buildings, we found this cob cottage very inspiring! We highly recommend this house, And our hosts were very welcoming."
1720832,9176060,2017-03-05T19:26:08Z,What a special place this is. Great farm animals and hikes at mount parke. Of course the home made banana bread and granola are the cherry on top! Thanks for a great weekend getaway from busy Vancouver.
8357,16941343,2017-05-03T15:11:14Z,"This is a fantastically unique home. It is set in a very idyllic area of natural beauty.

Off the beaten trail but so worth it.

I would wholeheartedly recommend everyone to stay here given the chance .

Thanks kitty for your hospitality.

Kim and Ciaran"
8357,4406068,2017-05-02T15:13:04Z,"The Mushroom Dome is legendary and hardly needs additional accolades - as of May '17, it retains all of the quiet charm described by previous guests, and is an unbeatable place to stay in the Santa Cruz area. Kitty and Michael are wonderful hosts. One of my best Airbnb stays ever!"
8357,785068,2017-05-01T10:31:10Z,Perfect getaway for those who enjoy nature's simple and beautiful treasures. 
8357,12078605,2017-04-28T16:26:26Z,The place is everything you think it's going to be (from the pictures and more). We arrived late so we didn't see the true magic of the place until the morning. Kitty was an above and beyond host. We had great conversations with her and learned a lot about the area and just in general. We also had a good time with her dog Elliot. The property is secluded and quiet. Inside the Airbnb is everything you'd need. We felt lucky that we got to stay there. 
8357,26382579,2017-04-26T15:52:46Z,"This place is a magical dream! The host Kitty is exceptionally thorough and friendly. We had a very lovely chat and she even offered us eggs from her chickens, and goats milk and cheese from the goats. The hiking trail on the property is beautiful and there are so many giant trees and flowers all around. We celebrated my fiances birthday and he said this was the best birthday he ever had. The Cabin is very clean and organized, and we had a lovely vegan Thai food dinner at a restaurant nearby, even though the kitchen is perfectly set up to cook. We would definitely love to come back here again. #1 booked airbnb in the world, what an honor to experience this. Thank you Kitty and Michael!"
8357,23585945,2017-04-25T16:28:11Z,the mushroom is so cute and tiny!i love it!
8357,42141977,2017-04-24T18:04:42Z,"What can I say except, WOW! The drive to the Mushroom Dome was beautiful, and we are given excellent directions by Kitty and Michael. Our check-in was flexible, and we were greeted by Kitty (and some fresh eggs from the chicken coop!) as soon as we arrived. Kitty showed us around, and we chatted for awhile which was awesome to get to know each other, and the history of the land and people we are staying with. As we cooked out on the grill that night Michael was awesome enough to come over with a jar full of their son's homemade soup which was so delicious! It was like staying at a family's house for sure. In the morning we checked out the area, talked more to Kitty and her neighbors, and took a hike around their land. Overall, such a beautiful and awesome place to stay. The people living there can be described just the same! I would love to come back. Kitty and Michael are such great hosts, and had the fridge stocked with fresh goat milk and the bet sparkling apple cider I had in a long time. 

I hope to visit this land and its great hosts in the future. Definitely a unique stay and memories to last a lifetime (just within 1 day!)."
8357,21778954,2017-04-24T01:49:40Z,"We had a wonderful stay at the Mushroom Dome, thanks so much for your hospitality, Kitty! Loved seeing the hummingbirds and chatting with Kitty, we will remember this fun stay."
8357,32533316,2017-04-20T18:40:51Z,"The sky is beautiful and so is the scene. 
We went on the small trail next to the house in the morning and it's so fresh. 
Thanks for providing the nice stay!"
8357,26535886,2017-04-20T01:19:48Z,"Perfect getaway to calm down and relax. For a couple like us, it was amazing. You can stay in bed, watch the tress or movies. Whatever you like. If you are more into animals, no worries, there are friendly goats, dogs, cats, ans the humingbird-“pub“ was so cool. 

Kitty and Michael are realy nice as hosts, showing you around and telling you stories about all that is around. 

So folks, if you want to stay here, be quick, it gets full 8 months ahead. There is a second option though..."
8357,117532816,2017-04-17T17:24:48Z,Kitty was a great hostess. My kids loved it. She took them with her in the morning and let them milk the goats. I have never seen do many hummingbirds. So glad we were able to experience this!
8357,118254997,2017-04-14T17:54:43Z,"The Mushroom Cabin is like no place else. While it is tiny, it's a very efficient use of a small space so it doesn't feel cramped at all. It rained the first night we were there and the sound of the rain on the roof lulled us to sleep. We were off doing different things every day (it's remote, yet surprisingly close to things too) but it's the kind of place you could just linger all day on the deck watching the birds or reading a book. The whole place has a serene energy and is a great place to recharge. A truly unique experience and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to experience it. "
8357,75778891,2017-04-12T18:46:44Z,"We loved this place and wished we could have stayed a little longer.  Kitty was such an amazing host and made this stay among our string of Airbnb bookings in just one week the best of them all.  My daughter loved the cabin, which was amazing as the pictures show.  Kitty also showed us a little about her life up there in her beautiful forest.  Aria enjoyed Elliot and Milo as well as Winterberry and her fresh milk.  

The cabin: worth a stay to experience.  The space is small but it was perfect for the three of us.  The bed was super comfortable and we were lucky enough to be serenaded to sleep by the rain.  The composting toilet was new for us but with Kitty's explanation, we were able to manage.  If we had more time, hanging out in the patio would have been nice but we were rained in so we will have to save that for another time.  

Definitely recommend this place for someone looking for some rest away from buildings and cars.  Aria cried when we got home becaise she misses Kitty and her animals.  Kitty, she wants to take you places now! We'll have to go back when a spot opens up.  Thanks for a wonderful time!!!"
8357,119695013,2017-04-11T18:07:46Z,Such a unique space! Loved the animals and redwoods!
8357,12943277,2017-04-10T15:47:15Z,We loved the Mushroom Dome. We arrived at night and it was amazing to wake up to views of the Redwoods. We also loved watching the Hummingbirds. The dome is a really sweet and special place. Kitty was very welcoming and provided plenty of information leading up to our stay. Thank you! 
8357,15793942,2017-04-09T18:18:48Z,We had a great time staying in this lovely secluded cabin surrounded by redwoods.  Perfect for two people.
8357,92477108,2017-04-06T04:22:51Z,"We enjoyed our stay at the Mushroom Dome Cabin, especially my 9-year old daughter. Kitty is such a warm and friendly host. "
8357,21981178,2017-04-03T18:13:29Z,We loved our stay at the Dome! Amazing unique place. Beautiful very & peaceful place! Great hospitality! Highly recommend!
8357,45569934,2017-03-31T18:10:27Z,"I took my three younger siblings to the Mushroom Dome for their Spring Break and they loved it! Kitty and Michael were very accommodating and allowed all of us to stay in the cabin even though it says only 3 people on the listing. We are all pretty tiny so we fit comfortably. My sisters are ages 7, 12, and 14, and they loved that they got to spend some time outdoors in the woods. They were also very fascinated by Kitty's brief lesson on hummingbirds. She even allowed us to milk her goat, Winterberry, and we got to try goat milk for the first time. Her animals were all very welcoming. Definitely a memorable stay! Highly recommend! Can't wait to return during the summer to see the Milky Way :)"
8357,6489643,2017-03-30T17:45:26Z,The Mushroom Dome cabin is very pleasant and the area around it is very pretty.  Recommended!
2437969,9475142,2017-04-30T17:34:49Z,"Everything we dreamed it would be and more :). The cabin is incredibly cozy and designed very well. It's nestled in between several redwoods. The property is quite and peaceful - very close to Russian River, which was an awesome day trip. There were neighbors relatively close by, but we didn't hear them the whole weekend. Rachel is very communicative and assisted in making our stay extra special. I will definitely recommend this to friends and look forward to staying again! "
2437969,11672065,2017-04-27T17:47:47Z,Very unique cabin on a quiet mountain street. Close to Sonoma wine country and several other cute towns. Would definitely recommend!
2437969,27368478,2017-04-25T16:00:08Z,"Rachel has created a really beautiful space, good vibes and forest life all around! The place is both simple and eclectic. She also has a great record collection available! "
2437969,48067479,2017-04-21T21:27:10Z,"Had a really relaxing low key weekend at Rachel's super cute A-frame cabin! Convenient to hiking and beautiful nearby beaches. Rachel had great recommendations of where to go and clear details. The cabin is charming and cozy- so nice to have the fireplace! We listened to records, read, and cooked while hanging out in the cabin. Really enjoyed our quiet getaway! "
2437969,733719,2017-04-18T15:40:06Z,"This is our second stay in the A-frame and it was as cozy and relaxing as ever. Rachel was a great host, again, and was easily reachable when we had questions. She also provided a lot of great tips on things to see and do. But the highlight was definitely relaxing on the back deck. Didn't spot any deer this year, but it was perfect nonetheless."
2437969,81156448,2017-04-11T17:41:30Z,"It's literally what you see in the photos! Bring some food, some drinks, some coals, leave your tech at home, and just enjoy the beauty all around you. Seriously an amazing, cozy, and romantic home."
2437969,109052825,2017-04-07T18:46:43Z,"Such an amazing place! My wife and I stayed here for two days. We made breakfast every morning while looking at Rachel's amazing collection of cookbooks and listened to the incredible records she has. Super close to a cute town where we got dinner both nights and we also went to the coast and red woods all in two days. It definitely got cold, especially because it rained while we were there. We used some of the firewood she had but I definitely recommend buying starter firewood from Safeway. We fell in love with this cottage. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2437969,40949255,2017-04-05T16:22:25Z,"Enjoyed our stay very much. Highlights: charming and cozy cabin, deck with view, full kitchen, shower with good water pressure, wood-burning heater, vinyl record player with excellent selection of music, library with loads of cookbooks, charcoal bbq, proximity to Russian River, Sonoma coast, and Guerneville. Rachel provided lots of helpful information. Cabin is closer to neighboring houses than expected, which makes it feel less private and brings some noise. Overall, wonderful cabin for couples looking to get away for a few days."
2437969,5679199,2017-04-02T16:21:25Z,"Rachel's cabin was exactly wanted we hoped for - a nice cozy getaway. It was the perfect space for two people. We enjoyed our nights listening to records, reading endless amounts of foodie magazines and cookbooks, and playing chess. The cabin is located in a quiet neighborhood, but close enough to Guernville if you want to go out for meals or stop by Safeway. (Be sure to stop by Big Bottom Market for their biscuits!) Rachel's instructions for check in was completely thorough and made sure we were prepared for our trip! Thanks again Rachel!"
2437969,73957492,2017-03-31T18:57:03Z,"Rachel's place is the most charming little cabin you could ask for. The cabin can get chilly in the morning (we stayed during late March) but the space heaters upstairs and downstairs help a lot, and theres also a wood stove if you find it necessary. My husband and I stayed here for a portion of our honeymoon, and found ourselves not wanting to leave! The surrounding towns have lots of charming little shops and restaurants/coffee shops, with really welcoming locals who made us feel like we really belonged. Rachel's place is really close to the coast, with lots of scenic outlooks and cool beaches, but it's also right in the redwoods, which are absolutely breathtaking. Rachel is super nice, and so helpful; she put together a whole list of things to do while in town based on our interests! The place has a rustic charm, so don't expect the same furnishings as you'd find in a 5 star hotel, but honestly this was just what we were looking for. Loved it, and we definitely want to return for an anniversary trip in the future!"
2437969,60144539,2017-03-26T16:41:02Z,Beautiful place! Highly recommend! 
2437969,86978,2017-03-24T17:58:37Z,"Our stay at the cabin was so wonderful. The space is cozy and clean. It's the perfect location if you want quiet and R&R. We went out for a few hours each day but spent most of our time in the cabin cooking, reading and listening to music. The wi.fi was great, the record player was a treat and the sleeping loft was so comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you Rachel"
2437969,75820618,2017-03-19T18:11:55Z,"Absolutely loved our stay in Cazadero!  The cabin was cute, comfy, and had a fantastic book & game collection.  Rachel was a fabulous host, and gave us clear directions to the property.  "
2437969,11399747,2017-03-17T16:19:49Z,"What an amazing getaway spot! This cozy cabin had everything we needed for a comfortable two night stay. We picked up groceries, grilled outside and ate under the stars! We also took in the beautiful redwoods and scenic river views. It's a great spot for relaxation and Rachel was very communicative and friendly. "
2437969,10019156,2017-03-15T18:15:35Z,"Great little rustic spot. Nothing fancy but quiet, pretty, and not far from vineyards, restaurants, etc. We enjoyed it. "
2437969,53749898,2017-03-12T17:17:01Z,"The place is great, quiet and secluded in a good way. There are great beaches 20 minutes away from the cabin.

I will definitely come back with my friend / partner for a short getaway. "
2437969,64101383,2017-03-09T17:37:59Z,"Rachel's home was very special. Nestled in the Russian River Valley beneath beautiful redwoods, it was a pleasure waking up every morning in this peaceful cottage. Listening to records in the evenings and cooking dinner and enjoying it on the porch made for a relaxing and enjoyable stay. The bed was cozy and the home had an overall great vibe, I wish I could have stayed longer! Nearby the Armstrong Woods, and also close to Jenner on the coast, this was a true gem I hope to visit again!"
2437969,112627370,2017-03-07T19:20:58Z,"WE LOVED RACHEL'S PLACE! My girlfriend and I didn't want to leave! From the great vinyl collections, to the fully equipped kitchen, Rachel's place was perfect for a few days away from the city. The drive was beautiful, and Rachel gave great recommendations on things to do during our visit (Goat Rock Beach is absolutely gorgeous)! Even though we brought some extra blankets, the cabin was very cold during our first night. After starting a fire and using the space heaters provided, the cabin felt like a home away from home. We didn't want to leave! Do yourself a favor and experience this for yourself, we will definitely come back!"
2437969,3941935,2017-03-03T17:39:49Z,"This place is so amazing, I'm hesitant to share for fear of it always being booked! Really, it's beautiful. The location is incredible, the house is very cute, it's decorated exactly how an A-frame cabin should be. I love this place! And Rachel is a fantastic host. We are so thankful for her hospitality and hope to return soon. "
2437969,33523493,2017-02-28T20:44:56Z,"A super cute, cozy, cabin retreat. Rachel's communication and directions allowed us to get there without any trouble. The fireplace was great at warming up the place, and the record player added a relaxing vibe. We also hit up Armstrong Woods just 20-30 mins away for a long hike in the redwoods. A great way to feel secluded from the city, but you could still pop into Guerneville about 15 mins away for anything you needed. Fridge is outside on the deck, but easy enough to access. There was a random assortment of spices and such, but if you plan on cooking, probably safest to BYO salt/pepper/spices/oil/vinegar. Overall, super lovely and I've already showed off the listing to many of my friends!"
13253,120691282,2017-05-01T07:17:40Z,Amazing. We will come back for sure!!  
13253,22432610,2017-03-12T11:24:44Z,"wow, this place exceeds all expectations!!! we stayed only one night, and how we wish we could have stayed longer! We arrived just in time for dinner, which was just fantastic! it was a 3 course meal, which was served at the big table in the dinning room. The place has an honesty bar where you help yourself to any of the great selection of drinks and pay for it at the end of the stay, which is a brilliant idea. 
We stayed in Greystock room and it was huge and beautiful. The big fluffy towel and the bath robes were a really nice touch. Breakfast again was simply delicious and you have a great variety of options you can choose from. The castle is just like a museum with the exception that you can walk anywhere you want and they also have a great library with a lot of old books. Simon and Wendy did a great job decorating this place, really good taste and really makes you feel like royalty. Also fantastic staff! I hope I didn't miss anything. would love to come back."
13253,7446712,2017-02-05T08:13:44Z,"Simon & Wendy's home is a fantastic getaway. It was affordable, easy to find and more incredible than we imagined. The castle is quite small which makes it feel cozy and magestic at the same time. The dinners with everyone also encouraged guests to be friendly which I thought was wonderful. It's a fantastic place and I will certainly be coming again."
13253,48072272,2016-12-12T11:29:07Z,The host canceled this reservation 173 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13253,104369583,2016-12-11T08:04:57Z,"Had an absolutely fantastic 2 nights at augill Castle, a truly memorable break away from the rush that is life. Felt at ease and relaxed from the moment we arrived making full use of the bar and relaxing by the fire. Already planning a return for the summer. Thanks to Simon and Wendy and all the staff :)"
13253,75150249,2016-11-24T09:11:01Z,"Great stay at Wendy's castle, I should have come earlier to enjoy the movie room and the bar at the castle. Wendy is a very nice host with fast response. Great castle experience. Thanks Wendy. :)"
13253,98376200,2016-11-03T11:12:28Z,"Wonderful place to experience UK. And there are lots of interesting collections, it's really amazing."
13253,96498927,2016-11-01T10:03:15Z,Beautiful location.  Very unique.  Wish I would have booked a longer stay.  Loved the bar very cute & the movie room.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice relaxing place that is highly unique. 
13253,53642033,2016-10-22T08:56:51Z,"We had a lovely stay at Augil Castle.  In fact, we loved it so much we stayed and extra night even though we had to switch rooms!  My husband and I were traveling with our 2 kids ages 10 and 12, who loved running around the grounds, hanging out in the library and watching movies in the small adorable theatre. 

Our meals were delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful.  Our favorite part - the honesty bar.  Like a kid in a candy shop, we got to choose from a large variety of British spirits and a wonderful wine selection and then hang out in a fabulous little bar or meander to the music room.  Dreamy.  

The rooms are delightful and all are different.  We spent 2 nights in the Little Castle, which is detached from the main castle.  It was very sweet, private and quiet with its own kitchen stocked with milk and tea/coffee.  We also spent 2 nights in the main castle, which was wonderful as well - unique beautifully appointed rooms.  

Wifi is spotty. We could get it reliably at the Little Castle but not in our rooms in the main castle.  If we weren't trying to plan additional parts of our trip this would not have been a big deal as it is lovely to disconnect. However, I do think it's important to know for planning purposes.  

We will definitely be back.  Highly recommended for all.  "
13253,91931288,2016-10-11T10:52:56Z,"We had a wonderful stay with our family at Augille Castle. We got an upgrade to Derwent and Raisbeck,and it was totally a beautiful experience and very thoughtful. The kids loved the library and the collection of toys. The dress and play is a really good touch for the kids. The best experience one could have in a lifetime. John was extremely helpful in showing us around the castle and with our needs. Great English breakfast . Awesome job done by Simon and Wendy."
13253,34589260,2016-10-10T08:53:45Z,"這是我們在Airbnb第一次住過的城堡,到了之後有兩個管家幫我們拿行李引領我們參觀,城堡內風格和設施讓我們覺得很舒適與驚喜,晚餐後到電影室看了場電影感覺很棒,自助泡茶區東西也很齊全,地點雖然不是在市區內但絕對能體驗到美麗的鄉村風光,總之這次的住房體驗超過了我們原先的期待!!"
13253,22566717,2016-10-01T07:14:36Z,"It is a special experience to live in the small castle. The castle locate near Lake District, it will take one hour if you go to there by car. The room furnish a little old. The breakfast is delicious and nice."
13253,78675446,2016-09-23T05:26:19Z,"We came to England and started our journey in Cumbria for our 31st wedding anniversary. For my husband Dennis and I it was a trip of a lifetime, one we planned for for years. Planning was hard but fate bought us to the ABnB site of Wendy and Simon. The most amazing and the true way to see the English countryside is just stay at Augill Castle l!! Start with your check in and as guests of Wendy and Simon you can plan English breakfast, teas and plates anytime you arrive (within reason of course.)The staff are amazing paying attention to you, making you feel as if you are the owners and not just a guest.  We have been to Manchester and London and  even though we saw the sights and checked off many items on our bucket list the best and brightest of Englands stars of hospitality and Olde English experience shines in the Castle Augill in Cumbria. Trust me when I say it is everything you've ever dreamed of and more,  no hustle, no bustle, just beautiful English countryside, wonderful food and who doesn't want to feel like a King and Queen for  a day or 2 or 7!!! Spend your time here you will love it!!"
13253,8113199,2016-09-17T09:35:39Z,"Simon and Wendy made our dream of staying in a castle come true without breaking the banks! They did a fantastic job renovating and breathing life into the old castle, and the place is so tastefully decorated and well-kept. This place is perfect for a weekend getaway: perfectly secluded (the closest town will  be a good 16-minute drive), rooms very spacious and private, and the common areas (the communal dining room, bar room, movie theatre...) are more than enough to keep you amazed and entertained for days. "
13253,29438334,2016-09-11T07:10:06Z,Like a Quing ( Queen and king ) it was really awesome living in a castle gosh
13253,31882033,2016-09-06T00:11:35Z,"We had a great time at Augill castle. The staff were very friendly, helpful and accomodating. The castle and and surrounding area are beautiful and peaceful. An amazing spot to just relax and enjoy your time. "
13253,84416410,2016-08-28T08:31:13Z,"We stayed during the Bank holiday weekend. Augill castle is an amazing unique place to stay. The pictures don't do it justice and it looks even better in real life. We stayed in the Langdale room which is great. You can dine with all the other guests on the same table which is a great experience if you like being social. There is also an honesty bar  which stocks a wide variety of British alcoholic (craft beers, wines, spirits etc) and soft drinks. Would highly recommend - who wouldn't want to live in a castle just one time?!"
13253,54187812,2016-08-22T01:45:26Z,"Wow, Wow Wow.  Congratulations Simon & Wendy you have created a magical visit to bygone days without any pomp & ceremony which makes for a warm and relaxing atmosphere.  It was a delight to stay at Augill Castle in the gorgeous Pendragon room. Beautifully furnished with  period pieces but with all the modern conveniences in the lovely bathroom. Sadly I didn't have time for a soak in the deep bathtub.  We joined some of the other guests for a 3 course dinner in the dining room. Each dish was delicious, beautiful presented and the meal was well priced. Breakfast was also very enjoyable.  The family and other waitstaff were all friendly and helpful.  We would have liked to stay longer and will certainly be recommending Augill Castle to everyone we know & to people we meet on our travels.
5 stars is not enough !!"
13253,81033741,2016-08-13T00:19:17Z,"It was a wonderful experience staying in the castle, beautiful room, comfortable bed and nice breakfast.The staff were friendly and helpful.We enjoyed the evening by the fire."
13253,73412989,2016-08-03T05:48:55Z,What an amazing trip to the Lake district. The castle has been beautifully restored. Loved it all and especially the owners and other guests. 
19606,196478,2017-04-30T17:26:04Z,Gorgeous house in a stunning location. Enjoy it!
19606,78188957,2017-04-28T18:24:46Z,"We loved our stay here.  Location was not like anyplace else we've seen.  

Be prepared to bring your own water, coffee, soap, shampoo. etc. "
19606,1172610,2017-04-26T16:10:46Z,This place is incredible. A super modern dream house in the middle of a road runner cartoon. You must try it!
19606,1546535,2017-04-23T18:10:52Z,"Incredible. A beautiful place to be, inside and out. We can't wait to return. "
19606,119538486,2017-04-20T15:55:38Z,"Spent a wonderful two days at Linda's home last week. Between the beautiful landscape and the gorgeous architecture of the home, I can't think if a better place to have gone to unplug and unwind. We'll be back for sure. "
19606,33244422,2017-03-12T15:06:28Z,"A quite perfect creation, set in the ideal desert setting. Exquisitely maintained, with every creature comfort.  "
19606,2186097,2017-01-31T17:46:29Z,"Linda's house is an incredible and one of a kind experience. We traveled there in a sedan, but would definitely recommend something with 4-wheel drive if you are planning to make a lot of trips in and out. We hiked through Gamma Gulch, visited the High Desert Test Sites, and got dinner at Pappi & Harriets. "
19606,104640666,2017-01-21T17:15:00Z,"Secluded, romantic, cozy, modern, beautiful respite."
19606,14014851,2017-01-17T07:13:01Z,"What a special place. Absolutely magical, peaceful, breathtaking, and inspiring. We loved the experience it offered us.  "
19606,4811105,2017-01-04T16:58:34Z,"Brrrrrr!  We had an absolutely frigid stay at this residence.  The power, and therefore heat and light, cut out every night and we froze!  Unfortunately, this is not conveyed in the listing description, but was relayed to us by the owner a few days before arrival.  We paid $496/night and had to bring our own drinking water, coffee, firewood.  I wish we had brought our own blankets as there are not enough at the house.  On top of that, the owner discouraged use of the fireplace.   We could not even take a shower.  We were not informed of a delivery to the house which required our interaction.  We won't forget our ice-cold stay here.  We feel seriously duped."
19606,14885769,2016-12-20T19:23:14Z,"Staying at this house, in this place, was like living in a dream. The beauty of the desert. The way the house feels like a living piece of it, warm with the sun and cool in the night. The stars the stars the stars. 

I sat on the warm concrete floor and watched the sun on the rocks and the jackrabbits for hours. 

Linda is a wonderful host, communicative and generous.  The house was equipped perfectly. The beds and blankets are soft, the kitchen has everything you could need and she has the best books. 

It's magic. I'm scheming on how and when to get back. "
19606,955547,2016-12-14T16:12:01Z,"Unsurpassed: The location, the house, the experience. Thank you Linda, for welcoming us to your desert paradise. After a coastal drive and some bustling urban adventures, the itHouse was the perfect off-grid escape and end to our honeymoon. The house was as described. It was impeccably clean, there was a great little book collection and a very comfortable bed. The house manual is very clear and straightforward. All we had to do was show up with our favourite food and drink and watch the sun and moon rise and set. We would love to visit again someday. "
19606,44382366,2016-12-07T16:22:53Z,"This is a beautiful building and home.  Linda was a gracious host, keeping me informed about the special circumstances of the off-grid experience and guiding me through it.  "
19606,89240430,2016-12-04T16:27:40Z,The location was lovely and perfect for our wedding! 
19606,85214726,2016-12-01T09:18:52Z,"Staying at this house was a birthday treat to myself. I think it was the best birthday I've ever had! I've dreamt of this house since seeing it in an article a few years ago. The house and the site are jewels. Words really can't describe the experience. The off-grid aspect made the house a living thing. I want an IT house of my own! 

I will never forget the time spent there."
19606,191335,2016-11-21T01:04:22Z,"Just like all the reviews have all written before me, this is a very unique, special place. You are surrounded by sublime desert wilderness. Our days at the house followed the rhythm of the sun—waking up at sunrise with the changing colors, watching rabbits and birds greet us from the floor-to-ceiling windows. It was magical.

The location is off the beaten path—it helps to have a robust car or SUV for the dirt roads to get here. We checked-in after dusk, but thanks to offline map data on our phones, we got to the house just fine. Arriving during daylight is highly recommended.

There is limited wifi available on-site now, but my partner spent the whole time off-line to truly feel disconnected. There is no TV, cell service (unless you hike/drive some distance away from the house), or a landline phone—so plan your trip accordingly.

Living off-the-grid with solar electricity and limited heating had us very cautious at first, but we lived comfortably—helped in part by the beautiful fireplace.

Supplies (or take-out) can be bought in nearby Yucca Valley, about 25-30 minutes by car."
19606,16195674,2016-11-13T06:26:24Z,"Loved it! Can't fault it! The house, location, hospitality, appliances were al great. Smooth and easy check in/out.

Loved Pappy & Harriets Pioneertwon Palace down the road for dinner/drinks. Tip: get the spare ribs!"
19606,4999152,2016-11-09T16:36:32Z,"Our experience of living Off Grid in this beautifully designed space was really incredible. It feels like you've been dropped into the wilderness and if you take the time to watch the landscape around you, it starts to come to life with desert animals; we even saw a coyote walk past the house at dawn. Watching the morning sun come round the rocks from bed was an experience we'll never forget. The house reacts to the position of the sun all the time, so that it feels like a totally different space in the evening than it does in the morning. If you're staying at the house in the Winter months, do be mindful of the shorter days in terms of the power you use, as the house is completely solar powered.
We will continue to recommend the Off Grid house to friends for a long long time. Thank you for our wonderful stay. "
19606,26795558,2016-11-07T00:46:59Z,"Really nice place to spend a (super) quiet and relaxing weekend. The house is very cool, and the surroundings are stunning. You have no choice but to relax, and take it all in. "
19606,43134243,2016-10-31T01:41:51Z,"thanks for reaching out beforehand, and checking (URL HIDDEN) feels as if this is an art space that you are sharing...very special.

"
1083329,113565292,2017-05-05T11:31:38Z,"To start with the positives, this location has an amazing view of Akuyeri; hands down one of the best. Being able to sit out on the porch to eat meals while looking over the inlet was such a treat. This place has all the necessary ammenties to cook dinners as well as get rest through the use of the blackout blinds.

The only issue I ran into was, I never received information to get the key. I sent Petur a message 2 days prior to our date of booking as well as the day of our booking to receive the key and he did not respond. Luckily there was another vacationer in the same building who had Petur's direct number which we called at which point he told us how to get in.

Otherwise this place was awesome and I would love to stay here again"
1083329,106636109,2017-05-03T10:51:43Z,"It's an amazing location and a modern decoration. The appartment is a bit smaller then expected. It is not a very family friendly place. We asked multiple times for baby beds, because we were travelling with small children. At our arrival there were no baby beds and chairs, so we had to improvise. For this money we expected more service. But if you're travelling only with adults it's an amazing place to stay! "
1083329,18321841,2017-05-01T02:52:23Z,"Great location in beautiful house. The view is incredible, also at night when the lights in Akureyri go on. "
1083329,55585792,2017-04-26T08:51:46Z,Really nice and stylish house. Enjoyed our stay and didn't want to go!
1083329,8199212,2017-04-21T10:04:13Z,"Gorgeous view, fantastic modern apartment.  Petur was quite helpful all along the way.  This was one of our two favorite stops along Þjóðvegur...and the apartment was part of the reason why.  I highly recommend it!"
1083329,38043743,2017-04-19T11:19:18Z,Awesome place in an awesome location. Recommended!
1083329,9845351,2017-04-09T08:42:16Z,Awesome view. Comfortable. Best stay in Iceland so far. 
1083329,22047671,2017-04-08T08:26:01Z,Super cosy; cool as hell; great position / location; good communication from Petur; decent value. Thoroughly recommend for a family of four / four friends
1083329,2116516,2017-04-05T10:51:19Z,"This was hands down the best Airbnb rental we have stayed at - the location is unbeatable. It looks and feels very secluded, but you are an 8 minute drive to Akureyri's restaurants and shops. The property had wonderful views, and there was everything you could possibly want in the kitchen. The entire place was incredibly cozy and inviting."
1083329,34032815,2017-04-03T08:14:22Z,"Great place to stay, good surroundings and close to Akureyri, very good internet connection and warm inside!"
1083329,41742364,2017-03-30T09:32:47Z,Amazing house and amazing location
1083329,79925821,2017-03-24T10:31:47Z,"This place is accurate to what the the photos show. The view is gorgeous. It did take us a while to figure out how to find the location (we were a bit tired from driving all day), but the hosts were especially accommodating with directions! Some have mentioned the issues of the stairwell, but the infrastructure is relatively sound, even with a few creaks here and there. The apartment is just right out of the downtown Akureyri so it's quick to eat downtown. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the location! "
1083329,31765864,2017-03-22T08:18:18Z,I had a wonderful stay here :) I love this house sooooo much !!! I will definitely come back here !!! I also saw the super nice northern light here :) and their kitchen are fully equipped toooo ~~ really appreciated ~~ thx for the super nice stay for us :) 
1083329,74315767,2017-03-19T08:48:31Z,"Amazing place in a quite area really closed to the city, just 10 min with a wonderful view."
1083329,44211714,2017-03-14T08:01:53Z,"Petur's place was the perfect getaway! It was about a 5 min drive to town, had a great view of the water and sunsets. It was so romantic to play cards and have a glass of wine next to the big windows. He even had beautiful wool blankets and wine in the fridge! Would stay here again in a heartbeat. One of the best Air b n b's that I have stayed in.  "
1083329,5832736,2017-03-12T09:21:10Z,Très bel appartement avec superbe terasse et vu sur la ville! L appartement est lumineux et chaleureux .facil d accès. Très bonne expérience.
1083329,81353023,2017-03-09T10:31:35Z,Beautiful house with a great view of the city. We were also able to see the northern lights
1083329,24497652,2017-03-04T09:17:03Z,"This location is incredible, unparalleled view of Akureyri. While it was a bit hard to find (in part because I was arriving when it was getting dark) the location and seclusion is well worth it. "
1083329,35760860,2017-03-03T11:30:53Z,"View here is definitely fascinating. Night view and day view are totally different. With music, lying beside the window is romantic!"
1083329,111155587,2017-02-28T11:25:51Z,"Nice place, the pictures look like the place will be bigger "
1621152,66842520,2017-05-10T12:39:40Z,"Very disappointing. Way to expensive for what it is. 
If you like camping you might like this, however if you are used to 5 or even 4 stars, don't expect much. 
Unbelievably dusty, dirty windows, tiny space, no wifi in your room , not private like you are made to believe. Other rooms and people enjoying their terraces looking straight into your tree house. Didn't tell us about the dug up swimming pool. No local wines to purchase in your room. Parking is quite far away on the other side of the property. No day bed or lounge on balcony to relax, just uncomfortable metal up right chairs. They even charge you for filter tap water from their communal tap. Also for that price we paid AUD$927 for two night, you'd expect a lovely full spread breakfast however the money grabbers want to charge you extra for that even when the room is way to over priced. We didn't bother staying the second night as we were so unimpressed. "
1621152,30107543,2017-05-09T06:46:13Z,"What a magical place, even better than I imagined! Teresa and Daniella were so helpful and awesome! "
1621152,17020475,2017-05-08T09:27:44Z,Amazing!
1621152,688968,2017-05-07T07:14:55Z,The treehouse is everything you see in the pictures and even more! Elena and her sisters are very helpful and kind. And they make an amazing breakfast. The location of the treehouse is wonderful! 
1621152,29735009,2017-05-03T08:29:44Z,The treehouse is amazing. Spectacular view and tranquality. You will need a car to get to Florence (15 minutes). Elena is a wonderful host. Everything was just perfect.
1621152,106672837,2017-04-29T08:27:13Z,"Amazing! Such an experience to share with my family.  Breath taking views of Florence, and perfectly manicured grounds! Host was extremely accommodating and friendly. Only negative was that we only had one night!  "
1621152,50155698,2017-04-28T07:34:49Z,Cool experience in a tree house. Built well. 
1621152,30598381,2017-04-26T08:11:42Z,"This place is a MUST SEE. My wife and I visited on our Honeymoon and even though it was just for a night, what a lovely time we had. Daniela cooked us a tremendous dinner that we enjoyed on the deck with a bottle of white wine. This was the perfect touch to an already incredible rental. We will be back one day! "
1621152,103663649,2017-04-25T08:01:20Z,"Se volete immergervi in un mondo surreale, nel verde e nella quiete la casa sul l'albero di Elena è il posto giusto, è stato un weekend all'insegna del relax e della pace. 
Siamo stati accolti in maniera sublime dalla mamma di Elena e Teresa ci ha supportato per tutto il weekend con consigli su dove mangiare e cosa visitare.
Servizio impeccabile, cortesia e simpatia. E' una esperienza che consiglio di fare a tutti."
1621152,16600983,2017-04-22T09:33:10Z,"ottima esperienza, meglio delle aspettative! Consigliato vivamente. Sono gentili e molto disponibili."

1621152,67466167,2017-04-19T06:58:55Z,"CasaBarthel is an amazing place to stay. The treehouse is so unique, you feel like you are in the middle of the countryside and the views are amazing. Elena was a great host, with good communication and a warm welcome. The setting just south of Florence is perfect, you get a feeling of being in real Tuscany. We will definitely be back again!"
1621152,11935103,2017-04-13T08:13:18Z,"Ein tolles einmaliges Erlebnis, was ich jedem empfehlen würde. Danke Theresa für wunderbare Betreuung und leckere Brioches am Morgen! Wir fanden 25 EUR p.p. für ein mediterranes Frühstück zu viel, und blieben bei dem inkl. italienischem - das reicht vollkommen! Auch haben wir auf das angebotene Dinner für 100 EUR p.p. verzichtet - man kann in der Umgebung fantastisch essen (Osteria degli Millionen ist unser Favorit). 
Danke euch, dass ihr versucht habt, das Problem mit lautem Boiler, der uns in der Nacht weckte, zu beheben. 
Die Aussicht und das Anwesen wie in einem Bilderbuch! 
Draussen auf der wunderschönenTerrasse hört man das nahe Autobahn ziemlich laut. Uns hat es aber nicht sehr gestört. Es gibt keinen Kleiderschrank o.ä. Vielleicht ist es der Grund, dass wir es etwas zu teuer fanden. Aber abenteuerlich und romantisch ist es auf jeden Fall! Für Designer/Architektur Fans ein Must Visit!"
1621152,12743143,2017-04-11T09:09:19Z,This was an epic stay in Elena's treehouse!  Our so was so excited a out staying on a treehouse.  It was gorgeous and surreal. The property is wonderful to explore and we want to visit again and stay longer.   Highly recommend! 
1621152,115621426,2017-04-10T08:58:41Z,简直太美了~
1621152,12872529,2017-04-08T09:55:28Z,"Ein Traum zwischen Himmel & Erde. Die besondere Unterkunft nahe Florenz. Hier konnten wir uns nach Kunst- und ShoppingTrips gut und gern entspannen. Allmorgentlich mit frischen schmackhaften Croissants versorgt, den Blick über Olivenbäume und die Dächer von Florenz gerichtet, freuten wir uns morgens schon wieder auf unser abendliches Domizil. Rundum sind Restaurants zu finden, die von den Vermieterinnen in einer umfangreichen Mappe beschrieben sind. Es war eine wundervolle Woche bei Euch - herzlichen Dank!"
1621152,58511055,2017-04-01T08:29:09Z,Perfect little get away 10 min from Florence 
1621152,9513484,2017-03-31T07:27:16Z,La casa de l'arbre és un lloc per fer una escapada tranquil•la. L'atenció de l'Elena és total i et soluciona qualsevol problema. La casa és espectacular i l'entorn fantàstic. Ja pensem quan hi podrem tornar. Moltes gràcies per rot Elena!!!
1621152,35050962,2017-03-26T09:27:54Z,Ottima posizione a due passi da Firenze. Spettacolare per la nostra bambina!
1621152,110240782,2017-03-23T10:34:34Z,Had a great time and couldn't beat the experience. The options were awesome! The only thing we couldn't find was the pool but it was bit to cold anyways. The overall time is amazing we only stayed for 1 but would recommend 2 nights. 
1238125,91725903,2017-05-11T00:59:53Z,We had a wonderful stay! 
1238125,37029985,2017-05-07T12:36:08Z,I absolutely loved my stay in the cottage! Beautiful grounds to walk around and enjoy a book. Close to great restaurants and hiking. 
1238125,3150538,2017-04-30T14:14:13Z,"The Silo was a wonderful place to spend a weekend outside of the city.  The silo is as peaceful and lovely as it looks, and Denise was gracious enough to give us a tour of the other properties and told us a bit about their history.  She was also fantastic with providing lots of great recommendations for the area for both activities and restaurants.  The 3 restaurants we ate at off of her list were all perfect.  Thanks again Denise! "
1238125,17906480,2017-04-25T20:27:11Z,"Beyond my expectations: the Santarella Gardens should be on your travel bucketlist if it isn't already. 

Quiet yet accessible, the Silo Studio was the perfect retreat and Denise and her husband were the best hosts. They were welcoming and so prepared, even in light of my last-minute booking. 

In the cottage, I especially loved the sleeping area and the sound of the river creek lulls you into a very calm state. As a music lover, they also have an iPod/aux cable dock and speakers so you can set a nice ambiance when you want. "
1238125,12771940,2017-04-23T12:46:45Z,"We stayed at the silo studio over a weekend in April. The location was idyllic; surrounded by nature and a chattering stream that wound its way through the property. The silo home itself was out of a fairy tale! Inside, the home was well maintained and functional. The highlight, other than the fact that this home is fabulously unique from the outside, was the bedroom. Comfortable and homely, large windows to let in light, and the distinct, calming sound of the stream.

Our hosts - Denise and Dennis - were very hospitable. Denise greeted us when we checked-in. She welcomed us into the warm home, heated by an efficient wood pellet stove and we immediately felt at ease. Dennis gave us a tour of the entire property on our last day and told us about the history of the place. They are both caring and attentive.

We had our golden retriever with us, and while she wasn't allowed off-leash on the property, the Tyringham Cobble - a vast space with open fields and trails - was less than a 5 minute drive. Our dog loved it!

Would definitely recommend this place to a couple looking to get away for a weekend in one of the most unique homes I have ever seen."
1238125,49569250,2017-04-21T14:11:00Z,"My girlfriend and I came to the silo studio for a couple days away, and we can not say enough about how nice the studio is. Denise was a great host, giving us plenty of options for activities, from dining to hiking. The silo itself is an awesome piece of work working and the inside is clean and cozy. "
1238125,119029325,2017-04-18T15:55:16Z,This is the place to take someone you want to be alone with 
1238125,107268914,2017-04-09T14:17:53Z,"Nothing short of amazing, if you're looking for a place to escape the daily grind, this place is it. Secluded, but close enough to quaint downtown areas and great museums. It's surely a unique property, and the only thing that rivals the greatness of this cottage is the hosts - they're top notch."
1238125,48255310,2017-04-05T12:11:40Z,The Silo Studio is fantastic! Makes you feel like you stepped right into a fairy tale. Highly recommended. Denise and Dennis are wonderful hosts. We had a great experience.
1238125,110827170,2017-04-02T14:12:09Z,"Would highly recommend this place. Gorgeous and secluded, yet minutes to the town of Lee and other area attractions. Perfect for a make your own adventure trip!"
1238125,4990567,2017-03-27T12:16:55Z,"The Silo Studio is exactly as pictured, a super lovely fairytale of a cottage. My husband and I were only able to stay a short time, but it was perfect for our needs, and a wonderful night away. 
The fireplace/furnace kept the studio quite toasty despite colder weather outside, and the bed was very comfortable. Our winter stay was beautiful, I imagine it would be lovely any time of year. Highly recommend!"
1238125,111202824,2017-03-26T15:55:40Z,"Exquisite, magical, and charming are only a few adjectives that encompass how wonderful this Silo is.  This location is truly a very special place, which I highly recommend visiting.  I have no doubt that it will exceed your wildest, expectations as it did mine!"
1238125,54770167,2017-03-24T15:23:18Z,The silo studio was magical and the area is right out of a storybook. Denise is super helpful and knowledgeable and easy to get ahold of when needed. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic getaway. 
1238125,101824827,2017-03-11T16:11:51Z,"If you are looking for a quiet relaxing getaway, this is definitely the place to do so. The cottage is just as beautiful as the pictures, and Denise was an amazing host. I would definitely stay here again. "
1238125,937199,2017-03-01T13:39:53Z,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Silo Studio Cottage! It was even lovelier than the photos suggest - the location, the grounds, and the silo are just magical! 
And you couldn't ask for lovelier hosts, Denise and Dennis, embody the spirit of kindness and generosity.
If you want a truly romantic, rustic getaway - the silo should be at the top of your list."
1238125,110075045,2017-02-26T13:30:58Z,Such a cute and charming little house- felt like I was in a fairytale! The property is beautiful and Denise really makes sure you have everything you need to make your weekend perfect. We will definitely be coming back! 
1238125,31927862,2017-02-12T13:10:23Z,"The Silo Studio is gorgeous! Denise and Dennis are wonderful hosts and were so helpful. We were given detailed directions, instructions, and recommendations, making the trip a breeze. We stayed here during the dead of winter and the cottage was so well equipped to handle the coldest nights! Such a lovely and unique experience, we can't wait to come back in warmer weather to experience the grounds more."
1238125,6328381,2017-02-05T15:08:56Z,Lovely cottage with a lot of character. Would highly recommend for a weekend getaway. Lovely hosts and easy to organise. 
1238125,101845536,2017-01-30T15:15:50Z,"My boyfriend and I came to stay at the cottage for a romantic birthday weekend away. I could not imagine a more perfect location for such a trip. The cottage and surrounding property is absolutely magical, even in the winter! Everything looks as if it were straight out of a fairytale. The cottage was very clean, well stocked, comfortable, and the pellet stove made it perfectly warm despite the cold outside. Denise was a wonderful host, and took the time to make sure we had everything that we needed. She also had the best recommendations for local restaurants/activities on our stay- we enjoyed every place she told us about. Really, overall it was an absolutely fantastic experience, and I would highly recommend. We will definitely be back!"
1238125,4393739,2017-01-28T16:33:52Z,"My boyfriend and I came to the silo cottage for a quiet winter getaway, and our stay was magical from beginning to end. Denise is a wonderful host who greeted us with a warm welcome, along with a bottle of bubbly. The cottage is truly magnificent - cozy and thoughtfully designed. In the evening, the warm fireplace provided a great backdrop to conversations over wine. The highlight of the cottage is the gorgeous second floor bedroom. It's hard to describe the feeling of wonder as we gazed out at the stars through the beautiful glass windows. We slept peacefully in the incredibly comfortable bed - the linens were luxurious, and along with the heated blanket, we were in heaven.

On the day we left, Dennis offered to give us a tour of the Gingerbread House. It was fascinating to hear about the history of the estate, and the love and care that he and Denise put into it. 

I highly recommend visiting and experiencing this magical place for yourself. I know that we are already looking forward to returning!"
1237965,60243591,2017-05-12T07:57:33Z,"Had the most amazing time in such a beautiful windmill. Clare has decorated it in such a stunning way, whilst keeping in touch with some unique original features.

Clare welcomed us with a tour and brief history of the mill and also settled us in with a welcome basket of goodies off the farm and local area.

This place will always have a special place in our hearts as we also got engaged during our stay ☺️ We will certainly be coming back one day!"
1237965,40611824,2017-05-10T08:16:31Z,"We had a great 3 night stay here. My wife and I were looking for somewhere to relax for a few days after our wedding and this fitted the bill perfectly. The windmill has been converted in such a clever way - it has retained a lot of the original features but has all of the modern amenities you would expect. Clare was very helpful in advising on walks, activities and places to eat. Was a memorable few days."
1237965,46402228,2017-05-06T07:15:57Z,"Claire, Your windmill is a truly spectacular place, which we were in awe of from the second we arrive. Your hospitality was wonderful & the extra treats we received were such a lovely touch. Thank you so much for your all help & guidance, we will most definitely see you again. Robbi & Hannah X "
1237965,110758944,2017-05-01T10:29:53Z,"We had an amazing stay in this beautiful windmill. The lounge, bedroom and bathroom were all excellent. There was loads of attention to detail and nice touches like eggs from the hens and fresh flowers. Cannot recommend enough!"
1237965,69090577,2017-04-28T08:47:50Z,"The most wonderful place. Unique, beautifully done up and very very special. It had absolutely everything we needed and more, from a fully equipped new kitchen to the most comfortable bed. Bathroom is perfect, with views across the countryside from the bathtub. In short, we struggled to ever leave! And Clare is wonderful. So kind and welcoming. We felt absolutely at home. We will be back for sure!"
1237965,2643505,2017-04-26T08:58:01Z,"We had a wonderful stay at The Old Smock Windmill. It has been beautifully restored & Clare is the perfect host. She's there if you need anything but never intrusive. We loved the little touches upon arrival, with the incredible fresh eggs and the baked bread. The surrounding areas are lovely, with plenty to do. Equally the windmill was so nice, we were happy to just relax and enjoy the peace and quiet. Thank you again Clare, we hope to visit again one day. "
1237965,51828643,2017-04-23T09:27:35Z,"Stunningly restored windmill in beautiful rural Kent. Could not recommend enough for a romantic relaxing get away. I would recommend the Bull in Benenden for dinner, the perfect country pub with a great menu and atmosphere."
1237965,22993788,2017-04-18T08:26:33Z,"We simply cannot fault our stay! A truly special place where we made very happy memories. Everything about our experience was perfect, from the beautiful decor and furnishings to the freshly laid chicken and duck eggs. We will definitely be back, thank you for being the perfect hosts! "
1237965,32565671,2017-04-12T07:25:13Z,"The windmill is a truly special place to stay, we had a great 3 days in the mill and around the surrounding area. The place was faultless and the extra touches like the fresh eggs and bread makes a real difference. Everything is very tastefully done to a high spec - then walk in shower, roll top bath and giant pillows being a highlight! 

Rye, with more tea rooms per square foot than anywhere I've been, and Camber sands, are about 30 mins away and well worth a visit."
1237965,57649807,2017-04-04T06:06:17Z,Amazing space and beautifully maintained and restored. Loved our time there. Clare was very accommodating and welcoming. Surrounding area is quiet and great for food and walking. Will be back. 
1237965,114637041,2017-03-29T10:54:56Z,We wholeheartedly recommend a stay at the Old Smock Windmill! It is perfect for a lovely relaxing get-away. The facilities are superb and Clare is lovely. We will definitely be returning and will also be telling our friends and family about it.
1237965,6143087,2017-03-22T10:32:26Z,"Clare's windmill is one of the most unique and wonderful places that I've ever stayed in. From the amazing views to the incredible building itself and the beautiful decor it's a lovely place to spend a few days. The building is so warm and cosy even on cold, windy and wet days. All of the features are fantastic, from the roll top bath to the walk in shower, large comfortable bed, copper sink, cosy stove and huge cast iron radiators. Great walks to the village (passing two fantastic pubs) and a short drive to the beach make it a lovely location. I would love to stay here again."
1237965,6672144,2017-03-14T10:30:11Z,"Every inch of the windmill begs to be photographed.  It's easy to see that Clare has put in a tremendous amount of time and effort to restore many of the original features, whilst adding her own design touches to make for a very enjoyable stay. To echo many of the other reviews, the hardest part was having to leave!

If, like us, you don't have a car - a torch will become your new best friend. Luckily Clare provided us with one for our walks back from the pub in the evening, and it was an absolute lifesaver! Very much looking forward to returning one day."
1237965,33994577,2017-03-12T11:14:53Z,We had a wonderful weekend at this windmill & will 100% be back at some time in the future. Would definitely recommend. 
1237965,28176986,2017-03-05T11:21:11Z,"The windmill is absolutely incredible. Clare has restored it to a beautiful and high standard. We didn't want to leave and loved everything about our stay. Clare is a brilliant host and we particularly loved the welcome gifts of freshly baked bread, flowers and eggs from the hens. The surrounding area is really pretty and there's lots to do. We would recommend anyone to stay here."
1237965,8522229,2017-02-27T09:52:17Z,"Staying at The Windmill, so lovingly restored, is a truly special experience. It has everything you need to hide away from the outside world-but also so many great places to explore nearby - including numerous fantastic country pubs! Staying in or going out you can be sure of a wonderful break- made all the more comfortable and enjoyable by your very welcoming, kind, helpful and thoughtful host Clare... and her chickens who provide you with great eggs for breakfast!  "
1237965,69347234,2017-02-25T10:26:50Z,"The windmill is beautiful, we've had a very memorable stay. The attention to detail is wonderful and Clare is a superb host, the homemade bread, fresh eggs and flower arrangement were a beautiful treat. "
1237965,36059062,2017-02-21T08:47:32Z,"We had the most wonderful stay at the Windmill. Clare the host was so lovely, leaving eggs, bread, milk etc for our arrival. The windmill itself is gorgeous. It has been renovated to a really high standard and the attention to detail is fabulous. We had such a relaxing stay and couldn't recommend The Windmill highly enough."
1237965,30601403,2017-02-11T11:09:50Z,"The photos don't it justice, an amazing place to stay. Clare was extremely helpful and welcomed us with freshly baked bread and some local apple juice. Would definitely recommend."
1237965,108047049,2017-02-07T09:36:36Z,"Words cannot do justice just how pretty amd bespoke the windmill is inside and out, it amazingly manages to have present day comforts and keeps its original character. Clare is an amazing host and very friendly! Will definitely return in the future."
2615058,25848268,2017-05-10T20:41:36Z,"Our stay here was nothing short of incredible. My wife and I had been bouncing around the big island, and she surprised me with this treehouse in such a private, peaceful spot. We were both instantly blown away with the structure, as the house is situated in a tall tree and tucked away from everything other than the sounds of the frogs, the trees, and the glow of the moon. 

We had a blast using the pulley to get our bags and cooler up to the house, and we drank, laughed, and played games on the wrap around porch until we couldn't stay awake any longer. In the morning, we sipped on coffee and enjoyed waking up in such a unique spot. The inside is as charming as the exterior, and we both rank this place as one of the coolest locations we have ever had the privilege to stay. Bravo! "
2615058,39596565,2017-05-04T19:36:06Z,"Who doesn't want to live out their childhood fantasy of living in a tree house, especially a tree house with so many beautiful upgrades that is eco-friendly to boot? This spot is truly a gem in the woods. It's quiet, secluded, and yet mere minutes from the National Park and the village. The bed was comfortable, the shower a warm welcome after a day of hiking, and the decor was inviting. Would highly recommend staying here! If you're quiet enough, you really will see the little pigs living in the woods, and maybe even some birds! It really is a gem and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone looking for a unique place to stay on the south side of the island."
2615058,107262028,2017-04-30T20:37:51Z,It's a dream come true. 
2615058,107641784,2017-04-29T21:50:39Z,Beautiful tree house! The space was utilized perfectly and would recommend to anyone. Price point is wonderful and the drive to nearby foods was not all that bad. If I'm on the big island again I will definitely stay again 
2615058,56126916,2017-04-26T06:14:29Z,The treehouse is the perfect place for a romantic getaway. It is very secluded and very private. Kristie has made the place very welcoming and is the best place when you just need to disconnect. The best part is at sunset listening to the frogs and watching the tiki lamps come to life!!!
2615058,110768474,2017-04-23T18:09:33Z,"This was a very unique and adventurous location to have a nights stay. The treehouse gave a beautiful view of the Hilo rainforest. The house was clean and well kept. The host also provides a manual, both on AirBnB and at the treehouse itself, that explains many of the treehouse's functions as well as some local activities and conveniences. The energy system run by solar panels and two deep cycle batteries so use your energy sparingly. The water is heated by a propane tank and provides an adequate shower. I would describe the treehouse as a once-in-a-life experience and that would definitely recommend to anyone. "
2615058,99402393,2017-04-16T19:31:14Z,Recommend for anyone wanting an amazing home feel on their trip to Hawaii! 
2615058,120967412,2017-04-15T02:15:19Z,This place was amazing. Very comfortable and cozy! Great experience to do in Hawaii. 
2615058,4647779,2017-04-13T18:11:25Z,"This gorgeous treehouse fulfilled every one of my childhood Swiss Family Robinson fantasies! It's gorgeously decorated, and the bed is super comfy. Keep in mind: This is a true model of off-the-grid living, so electricity is limited and water isn't potable. But these adventurous aspects make it all the more of a fun stay! Just know what to expect."
2615058,53172559,2017-04-10T18:41:55Z,It was our favorite place in big island!
2615058,9815920,2017-04-09T01:42:17Z,"My BEST Airbnb experience to date. Kristie's treehouse is one of the most unique, stylish, and romantic abodes I've stayed in. While the Big Island turned out to be a tad underwhelming, our one night stay at the treehouse was the highlight of the trip. Would recommend for any couples out there that want to get away from it all and reconnect in the rainforest to a soundtrack of birds, frogs, and other creatures roaming about. "
2615058,22776097,2017-04-07T20:32:38Z,"This is definitely the coolest airbnb I have ever stayed! The tree house is so pretty and modern. You surrounded by the jungle but still living a modern life. We spent entire day inside and took thousands of photos. The only problem is when it's cloudy we don't get enough electricity. But still, highly recommend this place. "
2615058,44108633,2017-04-06T19:30:47Z,"This treehouse is pure magic! It was lovely falling asleep to the sounds of the jungle and then waking up surrounded by trees! I wish we had more than one night here and hope to return someday!!! This is an experience you won't want to miss! Added bonus, it is conveniently located near the National Park. =D Thank you Kristie! "
2615058,5937294,2017-04-05T19:17:19Z,"We absolutely loved our two days in this magical treehouse. From the second we climbed the ladder and pushed through the trap door, it felt like something special. It's tiny, but items are thoughtfully placed around, down to the welcome Macadamia nut brownie, and even makeup remover wipes (which were a blessing since I had left mine behind). The shower, open to the forest, is a special experience (though hot water doesn't last a terribly long time, so don't dawdle). We slept like logs in the comfy bed with the frogs lulling us to sleep like an IRL sound machine. Two tips for travelers (aka learn from our mistakes): Make sure to bring ice for the kitchen cooler! We bough groceries and then had no ice to keep them chill. And make sure to unplug the coffee machine after breakfast. We forgot to do this and drained the power accidentally so had to let it recharge before we got more. Easy things that are in the guidebook, but slipped by us.

Mahalo Kristie!"
2615058,73124832,2017-04-03T18:54:21Z,"이국적이고 정글에 온 느낌이 납니다. 사진과 아주 똑같이 되어있습니다. 숙소 들어가는 길이 비포장길을 조금 달려야 해서 SUV 렌트 하는걸 추천합니다. 물이 잘 나오지 않고 따뜻한 물이 나오지 않아 샤워는 불가능 합니다. 너무 어두워지기전에 체크인 하시기를 바라며, 식사를 하고 들어가시던지, 주변 마트에서 구매하고 들어가서 식사하기를 바랍니다. 하루 정도는 감내하고 머물만 하나 그 이상은 정말 정글 체험을 하고 싶으시면 머물기 추천합니다. 신혼여행으로 왔는데 부인이 분위기에 아주 만족 했습니다."
2615058,91647150,2017-03-29T21:12:02Z,"We came here for 3 nights of our honeymoon and really loved it. It's a really nice juxtaposition to staying in a big resort filled with other tourists. If you're looking to really feel like you're in your own little world then this place is for you. The treehouse is in a great location close to the volcano national park but in a residential area where you feel totally secluded. There is a coffee maker on site as well as flatware and plates in case you want to make simple snacks at home. The power wasn't working when we arrived, but Krisitie was very responsive and sent someone to fix it within 15 minutes. We loved how the shower looks but could only get the water temperature to be super hot or cold. As long as you're aware that you are in a treehouse living off the grid then you will enjoy your stay! It's a beautiful and unique little oasis."
2615058,81917804,2017-03-24T18:26:32Z," I cannot wait to go back! From start to finish, the experience was an adventure. "
2615058,35238011,2017-03-23T21:59:26Z,This treehouse is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of day to day life. My husband & I stayed here for 2 nights just to disconnect and this location was absolutely perfect for it. It was still close to many of the activities we wanted to do during the day and perfect at night to just talk and enjoy each others company instead of having our faces glued to a tv. We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get away and just enjoying each other's company.
2615058,104551940,2017-03-21T21:52:37Z,Great place to relax and unwind she did a very nice job with the decorations and furnishings being a Gearhead I like the way she had her Plumbing setup and electrical was impressive
2615058,53806365,2017-03-18T18:58:12Z,"This was a beautiful tree house and I'm so glad we decided to stay here. It was nice to get off the grid and live simplistically. The space is surrounded by amazing tall trees and you feel as though you are in the middle of a rain forest. As we arrived we noticed the only way up was by a steep ladder with a latch roof which would be almost impossible to lug our suitcases up. There is a pull rope accessed by the balcony but our bags were a little to big and heavy for this. I would recommend keeping your big suitcases in your car (assuming you have hired one) and bringing a smaller bag up. This makes it easier when your packing up as well. One other thing I would mention is the shower, now of course you can't expect a hotel quality shower here but just a word of warning that after being in the shower for about 30 seconds it turned off and took another minute before water came out again. My recommendation would be to shower during the day (when it's warmer) and just be prepared to be standing in the wet for a minute or so. overall I would definitely recommend this place as it was an amazing experience, especially waking up to the beautiful sunrise shining in behind the trees :)"
156247,69446934,2017-04-23T13:22:01Z,"Ótima casa bem equipada com uma vista que só quem vai entende. Ótimo atendimento de Anthony, seus caseiros a pronto atender, tudo ótimo. Vale a pena ficar uma semana na casa escutando aquela água batendo nas pedras. Lugar para quem quer descansar e desfrutar da natureza. "
156247,111772835,2017-04-11T12:21:46Z,"Uma paisagem paradisíaca porém alguns pequenos detalhes podem tornar a estadia perfeita: melhorar a limpeza da casa, consertar a parede da lareira que está toda trincada e mofada causando cheiro forte na sala, reforma e pintura do deck externo que está ""feio"", trocar lâmpadas queimadas (No banheiro da suíte, das 3 lâmpadas existentes, 2 estavam queimadas), lençóis, fronhas e toalhas de mesa bastante amassadas/marcadas, área comum da churrasqueira suja e pouco organizada. Deixaram um cobertor de solteiro na nossa cama de casal (sorte que levei de casa). Encontrei aranha e 2 baratas na casa (sei que o ambiente é propício mas uma dedetização deve ajudar). Na saída, passado menos de 10 minutos do check out, a esposa do caseiro entrou na casa dizendo que tinha que limpar. Informamos que já sairíamos (estávamos terminando de descer as coisas). Sei que horário é horário mas achamos desnecessária tal ""pontualidade"". IMPRESCINDÍVEL substituir o colchão da suíte (unico que utilizamos) pois o colchão é de molas pouco confortáveis e faz muito barulho de ""ferro com ferro"" quando deitamos ou nos viramos na cama. No mais, cozinha bem equipada e muita (URL HIDDEN) certeza, esperava um pouco mais após ter visto as fotos e lido tantos comentários com elogios."

Area is great, but w were told not to walk any where .We are used to walking and felt a bit cut off..but we hired a car, and found some great restaurants."
156247,24067680,2017-03-25T11:24:36Z,"O lugar tem grande beleza, ótimo para relaxar, curtir a incrível vista e o som do mar. O ideal é ir de carro ou alugar um para a estadia. Os caseiros são pessoas maravilhosas, amigáveis e honestas. Sem eles estaríamos perdidos lá. Grande abraço a eles."

Expect to take the car for everything. Very helpful people in Andrade supermarket and good food in Palmas at Raizes. I wouldn't call it young child friendly. "

Fomos muito bem recebidos pelo Sr. Neri e sua esposa, responsáveis pela manutenção impecável da propriedade. Voltaríamos sem pensar duas vezes! Talvez poderia investir um pouco no mobiliário (cadeiras e colchões), mas isso de forma alguma ofusca os momentos inesquecíveis vividos naquela casa. "

As fotos condizem com a beleza do local e o fato de se ter uma praia privativa em meio à natureza é um luxo só. Governador Celso Ramos é um local adorável, cheio de paisagens impactantes. Adoramos a experiência! Queremos voltar em breve."

Poder dormir e acordar com barulho da água na pedra não tem preço. O acesso é muito fácil e o caseiro foi atencioso durante toda estadia, pude passar bons momentos com minha noiva com privacidade e sossego. A cozinha é completa, ambiente limpo, área externa e praia particular muito bem cuidadas. Uma pena foi não poder usar a lareira por algum problema de rachadura, o que não afetou em nada os bons momentos vividos na casa. A minha sugestão para o Anthony seria colocar uma rede no espaço da sacada, pois sem dúvida é o melhor ambiente da casa! Recomendo o lugar e pretendo voltar um dia. "
39492,49045726,2017-05-04T17:10:59Z,"We loved our stay at Jay and Stephanie's homesteader cabin. It truly is a special place in the desert where you can settle in and relax while enjoying beautiful sunrises and sun sets. It looks exactly like the photos. It's comfortable, peaceful and cozy. The outdoor shower is really cool! Jay greeted us at check in and showed us how everything works, letting us know he was just up the road if we needed anything. You can completely unplug or plug in as there is Wifi. It was such a memorable trip and we highly recommend it, whether for a low-key, chill vacation or a place to write your next novel. We also recommend ordering daily fresh juices from Angela as well as a piece of her golden milk pie! They are delicious and she is lovely. "
39492,113450538,2017-04-30T18:21:01Z,Great experience!
39492,37743870,2017-04-28T18:52:17Z,Loved staying at this cute little cabin! Everything needed was provided; everything was as expected. It's quiet and peaceful- really nice time to relax and unplug a little. Kind of like a camping experience but without as much work :) Jay communicated well and gave us a great rundown/tour of the place. Would definitely be back again! 
39492,1394877,2017-04-24T18:59:55Z,This is a fantastic place to stay in the Joshua Tree area. The photos don't do justice to this cabin and the surrounding desert especially during sunset. The cabin has everything you need for your off-grid getaway. You're still only 15 mins from food and groceries though. We hung out on the lovely porch most of the time. Jay met us during checkin and gave us a tour of the place and tips for what to do. Great hosts!
39492,13887,2017-04-22T16:44:28Z,"Beautiful views, spaciousness in the desert, stars in the expansive sky, 20 minutes to Joshua Tree, a special and sacred place to stay. "
39492,20876923,2017-04-19T17:20:14Z,Fantastic location- just what we needed!
39492,29827323,2017-04-16T18:26:00Z,"This cabin is a win! If you are looking for peace, great views, great host and a quaint place to stay, you have found it. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Jay and Stephanie were very accommodating and came down to meet with us upon arrival to show us around. Shower and toilet are outside and well maintained. It was a fun and peaceful getaway in nature. Super close to Joshua tree national park (about a 15 minute drive). Be sure to sit on the patio and enjoy both the sunset and the stars.  "
39492,10624395,2017-04-14T17:11:02Z,"The location was amazing. We enjoyed being away from the hustle and bustle of life. This unique cabin is as listed. It's charming, unique, quiet, and rustic. It's truly a gem. "
39492,29641583,2017-04-12T17:12:16Z,"Hier bleibt nicht viel zu sagen als: ""Go Go Go"". Eine Unterkunft die positiv i Erinnerung bleibt! "
39492,8358864,2017-04-10T18:27:18Z,"This is a lovely cabin. We stayed here one night and found it absolutely delightful. Jay gave detailed instructions for how to get there and met us at the property to give us a tour. All super easy and painless. 

Also had a great night at Pappy and Harriet's - strongly recommended! "
39492,3316580,2017-04-09T18:25:33Z,"In der Wüste gelegen. Die Nachbarhäuser mit großem Abstand.  Manchmal absolute Stille. Sehr beruhigend. Tolle Aussicht auf die Berge.

Die Hütte ist sehr einfach und gemütlich. Die Küche ist mit allem ausgestattet. Die Dusche im Freien macht Spaß. Das Plumpsklo war nicht so meins und war auch nicht sauber.

Die Kommunikation mit Jay lief reibungslos. Er war immer verfügbar.

Ich habe die Zeit dort mit mir alleine dort sehr genossen. Ein guter Ort zum Nachdenken."
39492,26059674,2017-04-01T16:49:13Z,"We loved staying here. Loved feeling off the grid. Loved the quiet, the night sky and the beauty everywhere. The homestead provided everything we needed and was very charming. We happened to be there during a very abnormal weather phenomenon- a dust storm with 80 mph winds. Jay kept in contact with us and made sure we were hanging in there which we appreciated- as we are from San Francisco and have never experienced anything like that. We hope to come back!"
39492,113701439,2017-03-29T15:02:50Z,It's a beautifully simple and rustic place! Take the time to enjoy the goodness and simplicity of life :)

39492,108859206,2017-03-21T18:55:51Z,"Joshua Tree is a really magical place and I'm so glad I got to stay here in particular. My everyday life is flooded with technology and this was a welcome oasis that was quiet and peaceful yet still near enough to anything you could need. The outdoor shower is amazing, and a totally unique experience coming from the northeast. Every day I woke up to incredible new wildlife, fresh air, beautiful colors and landscapes, wandering and hiking, and the day finished with dramatic sunsets and a good book. I only met Jay (after tumultuous and erratic travel out of the stormy northeast) and he was incredibly kind and welcoming. He told me all about the house and walked me through how to use everything, including details about the local animals (I love animals so this was particularly thrilling) and plants. He even flagged me down on my way into town to show me a tortoise that was making his way along the side of the road! I would recommend this spot to anyone and would love to return in the future myself!"
39492,71840377,2017-03-11T17:00:08Z,Amazing cabin.  Impeccable design.  Perfect location.  This was the ideal getaway trip for us.  We felt totally at peace at the Sonora Cabin!  Jay was super responsive and we appreciate the time he devoted to explain the history of the Sonora Cabin and their move to Joshua Tree.  We also loved Angela's juice :) 
39492,13460808,2017-03-06T17:37:29Z,"Lives up to the wonderful photos!  Glamping at its best.  Really everything you need in a rustic setting, even including wi-fi.  So close to the national park and great hiking.  This is the place to get away from it all!"
39492,112283212,2017-03-04T17:40:09Z,"The cabin is off the beaten path, but not so far that you can't drive out and pick up necessities for your stay.  It is extremely quiet at night, very beautiful during the day.  The cabin is equipped with everything you need for cooking, and has a small stove, oven and fridge.  The bed was sooooo comfy.  There's plenty of reading material for just chilling out and relaxing.  I really wish I could have stayed for a week!  But I will definitely come again at some point and I would say if you are good with solitude, then this is the place for you.  Stephanie and Jay were lovely with communicating with me, and were there promptly on my arrival to show me around.  "
39492,16518108,2017-03-03T19:19:12Z,"Lovely cabin, lovely view and great hosts. We did not want to leave. Highly recommended!"
39492,23618830,2017-03-01T17:19:43Z,Everything was perfect!!! The cabin is a dream. Jay is very nice. We will come again :)
3021762,126222075,2017-05-02T05:44:51Z,Nicely located comfortable Villa with very friendly staff and host.
3021762,109591219,2017-02-24T01:19:08Z,"Really enjoyed our stay! Quiet, comfy and clean :) great pool"
3021762,74237461,2017-02-17T01:14:48Z,"The villa has a relaxed feel and has basic kitchen set up, great for morning breakfasts.  Pool, shower towels and linen are all supplied.  One note, the lane way does flood a bit in heavy rain so pack a couple of pair of thongs."
3021762,13899335,2016-11-19T02:48:28Z,"Charming House, Loved the atmosphere. Communication before we arrived was great. Highly recommended. "
3021762,6878361,2016-11-16T01:31:55Z,Great villa! I recommend
3021762,82430444,2016-11-02T00:23:47Z,"The love villa 4 is absolutly great! The location is superb - only 5min to the great 66beach and 2min to restaurants and shops. Anyhow it's much more calm and relaxed area than the busy Kuta centre, which can still be easily reached by taxi in 20-30min depending on the trafic and will cost under 50k rupias (so super cheap). Everything was as promised with the villa and Erni and the rest of the staff were amazing. I was only hoping that the pool would be a little more exposed to the sun, since it's difficult to spend the day by the pool if you wish to get a tan! But it's no problem since the beach nearby is awesome! Would absolutly stay here again and recommend it to everyone."
3021762,34635867,2016-09-30T02:01:44Z,"Robyn was a wonderful and communicative host. We did t actually meet her but she was so helpful in all our communication. Also particularly helpful was Erni, the manager. The location of the Villa was wonderful, right at the top of Legian and not too far from Seminyak. We really enjoyed that this villa was set back from the busyness of Legian, down the end of a quiet  dead end street/lane. It is very easy to get taxis at the end of the lane. The villa was a little older and smaller than it appeared to me in the photos but it didn't matter because it was still a very long decent size for our family of 5. The pool was lovely. Someone mentioned in a previous review that is wasn't suitable for young children. All villa pools in Bali are deep with just one small step, so if you do your research and come prepared with swim rings etc, this is not a problem! The provision of drinking water was very helpful and we really like that this saved on the waste of plastic bottles! Overall, a wonderful stay in a very central part of Legian (far away enough from Kuta!!) with fantastic hosts! Thanks "
3021762,91034667,2016-09-14T05:27:07Z,Robyn was a great host her staff were amazing and the villa itself was perfect. We couldn't have asked for anything better. We didn't want to leave. 
3021762,40378500,2016-09-05T03:53:14Z,Ein netter Empfang durch Villa Manager und herzlichst von Robyn. Reinigung täglich sehr diskret und zurückhaltendes Personal. Alle sehr freundlich und angenehm. Man hatte sehr gut seine Privatsphäre. 
3021762,36553892,2016-08-22T08:43:20Z,"Beautiful villa, great location "
3021762,35432200,2016-08-15T10:53:13Z,We had a very lovely 5 day stay at Love Villa 4! The place is very homely and perfectly clean. Ernie was there to meet us on our arrival and made her best efforts to ensure we were happy and comfortable at all times. Thank you for your kind hospitality. 
3021762,227210,2016-08-01T00:55:46Z,"Based on the other positive reviews here, I can see that some people are fond of the Love Villas, but our family of four with two small children, ages 6 and 8, found this place, especially Legian, to be a big disappointment. There are several things I wished I had known about this place before booking it for a full week. 1) The pool only has deep water, about 5 foot deep, no shallow end and no ladder for kids, so it is not suitable/safe for young children. 2) The bedrooms have AC (2 of them have good functioning AC, in the third it barely works) but the bedrooms have no natural light, so you feel like you’re in a basement. But if you sit in the living/dining/kitchen area, it is stifling hot as it is a courtyard with no breeze. The bathrooms are also sweltering hot. 3) A second floor balcony in the neighboring property has a direct view into this home’s living room/pool/dining area, so no privacy when those people are on the patio. 

But the biggest problems were with Legian itself. 1) Trying to make excursions in the area—Canggu, Nusa Dua, Uluwatu, etc—was frustrating because Legian is choked in traffic. One review here says it is a 10 minute walk along the beach to Seminyak Square—not true—it is about 40-45 on foot or 30-45 in a taxi due to traffic. Canggu is 7 km and it took us an hour in cab. 2) Some of the streets in this neighborhood, including Werkudara, a busy road you’ll need to use to get to the beach, as it leads right off the alley where love villa is, has no sidewalks for long stretches, so it is unpleasant/unsafe to walk around with small kids.

The advertisement says this is where to find an “authentic” Bali experience. We traveled around Bali and Legian is anything but authentic. It is filled with souvenir stands, all with an identical array of tacky, in some cases offensive souvenirs, cheap massage parlors and Aussies in search of a good time. Both on the neighborhood streets and on 66 Beach (home to many beach bars that play loud horrible music) you are constantly accosted by people trying to sell you things. The beach would be great if it was quiet and had cheaper sun beds available but sadly, the chairs are ridiculously expensive. ($25 per day and up.) In summary, Legian is not a relaxing place nor an authentic one. Try Nusa Dua or East Bali (Sideman is great!) 

The host also is strict about cancellation and wouldn’t let us check out early (no refund) after we expressed dissatisfaction. All this said there are some positives too: Erni, the manager is great, smooth check-in, the wifi worked well, daily housekeeping, and free bottled water to name a few. Finally, the host offers airport transfers for 200,000. We went with Blue Bird Cab with a meter and it cost only 78,000. 
"
3021762,56560624,2016-07-17T02:10:35Z,Ernie our host and her family were amazing .Nothing was a problem to organise .We were lucky to have Robyn there at the same time and she was  so freindly and helpful even though she was trying to have a holiday with her family. Location perfect . The photos you see on aiirbnb liveD up to my expetitations. I will definetly be recommended Tis villa to my friends. 
3021762,63978814,2016-06-19T01:26:14Z,I know maybe it seems too much that we just had a fantastic experience - but we really Loved this place!  The location first of all was prime for our family of 5.  The space was perfect.  The staff excellent.  Robyn's décor here gave us the cozy feeling to make ourselves at home.  Will for sure return to one of Robyn's villas.
3021762,39964057,2016-06-13T05:52:22Z,"This villa was stunning. Cosy but comfortable with a nice pool. Great staff, excellent wifi and TV channels. Can't complain about anything. "
3021762,1968126,2016-06-10T09:58:00Z,"We had a great stay Robyn's place.  The location is fantastic.  It's on a quiet alley/street close to Double 6 Beach and restaurants.  The building is old, but quaint with lots of character.  Great staff.  We would definitely come back. "
3021762,29352438,2016-06-03T07:54:15Z,"We loved our stay in the villa. Relaxing decor, nice location, good value."
3021762,8791305,2016-05-17T01:54:05Z,"Really great find - close to the main area and beach so fantastic location and Robyn and her staff were very welcoming. 

The villa is tastefully decorated and great attention to detail. Clean and cozy, our oasis in busy Seminyak. 

Will definitely stay here again. 

Thanks Robyn!"

Having access to a washer was extra great!"
53243,22499738,2016-10-01T06:27:42Z,"This is a wonderful Trullo.
In beautiful surroundings. We couldn't have had a better weeks break. Isa is a fantastic host. Her info pack has plenty of information and  her recommendations are spot on. 
If peace and quiet is what you like but lovely places to visit within easy reach this is it. We'll be back."
53243,8883047,2016-09-18T08:02:55Z,"Isa was a good and charming host and most obliging. The fridge was well stocked on arrival. A relaxing,quiet and very private home with views across the vast olive groves. GPS failed us so get detailed instructions for location. "
53243,12117942,2016-09-16T08:50:22Z,"Isa is a nice host. She made everything for a perfect stay! Her place is like a little paradise surrounded by nature, a beautiful garden. We were able to make a fire almost every night, was a great ambiance.

thank you Isa!"
53243,53214980,2016-09-10T03:12:57Z,Isa was such a wonderful host - so helpful and welcoming.  This was the highlight of our trip to Italy!  The trullo is beautiful and ideally situated for exploring the region.  We really appreciated Isa's helpful advice and recommendations.  Thanks!
53243,30632371,2016-08-22T04:57:33Z,"Isa was incredibly welcoming. She stocked the fridge with cheese, ham and olives along with a basket full of bread, wine, eggs etc. we had arrived late so this was such a welcome treat. The area is amazing with a local town Casalini only 5 mins away. The trullo was so peaceful, no one around, very charming with a lovely hammock and outdoor seating."
53243,37409448,2016-08-16T08:17:45Z,"Trullo aromatic green is the most perfect of places to stay. 

Isa is an amazing host, taking time to show us around and sharing the history of this extraordinary trullo. On our arrival both food and wine was available - after a long journey we were very grateful for such thoughtful provision.

The trullo itself, whilst having an incredible history - its origins and careful conservation - has modern amenities needed for a restful stay. It's a very special place, cool (despite the wonderful Italian heat) and its outside spaces allow for long lingering lunches and evening meals. The view(s) from the trullo are Puglian picture perfect and we enjoyed picking fruits and herbs from Isa's land. We can't wait to return. "

Isa est très adorable et disponible et nous a même fait faire une visite guidée de Ostuni! "
53243,2770179,2016-07-19T10:29:50Z,"Isa was a wonderful host, and the trullo was beautiful. Photos don't do it justice.  We can't wait to come back to the region. "
53243,27888598,2016-07-14T01:26:44Z,"We had a great Italian holiday lodging at Trullo aromatic green. Arriving later than expected on our first evening, Isa made us very welcome providing us with local cheese, bread, fruit and vegetables and helping us to settle in easily.
We loved the house, suitated beautifully within olive, fruit trees and many other plants. It was spacious enough to accommodate our teenage son and his friend on one side of the hall way and me and my husband on the other side. The two bedrooms and bathrooms gave all of us some privacy and independence.
We enjoyed exploring the local beaches and the two small towns of Cisternino and Ostuni. All of Isa's recommendations were accurate and let us find some excellent restaurants with delicious dishes.
The only sad thing was that we had to leave after 10 days."
53243,5857930,2016-06-05T00:56:10Z,"We spent one week in this beautiful Trulli, surrounded by a wild and dreamy garden. There's a lot of trips you can do to the surrounding beaches, or you just stay at home and enjoy the stunning landscape. Isa is a great host! She will spare no effort to help you with tips and the fruit and vegetables she offered us were delicious!"
53243,37482860,2015-10-15T12:13:28Z,Isa was very helpful when we got lost (raining at night and our GPS failed) - so she came out and found us and guided us back to the Trullo. It is the most beautiful property and we had a wonderful 5 days there. We enjoyed cooking and eating the wonderful local produce that Isa had collected and left for us. It is the quintessential italian rural holiday that I have always dreamt about. So grateful to have had this experience. Thanks Isa.
53243,37470889,2015-10-05T12:23:34Z,"Isa ist eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Wir waren eine Woche in dem Trullo und wurden bei der Ankunft sehr herzlich aufgenommen und haben uns sofort wohlgefühlt. Das Trullo ist liebevoll und gemütlich eingerichtet, der Garten einfach wunderschön. Dort gab es überall schön gestaltete Ecken, an denen mann sich verweilen konnte. Üppige Rosmarin- und Lavendelbüsche, viele verschiedene Bäume und riesige Kakteenpflanzen. Es war angenehm ruhig und wir konnten uns super erholen.  Isa gab uns Ausflugstips für die Umgebung...hat sich toll um uns gekümmert. Die 'Umgebung mit den vielen Olivenbäumen einfach beeindruckend. Es war alles da was man sich wünscht und es sieht tatsächlich so aus wie auf den Fotos!!!
Wir waren bestimmt nicht das letzte Mal bei ihr.
"
53243,39953904,2015-09-27T15:12:14Z,"Isa’s trullo is a lovely, characterful place, and we immediately felt at home. The house was pleasantly cool inside, even during the scorching September heat, and very relaxing outside. Do try the hammock. The garden is a joy: prickly pears, pomegranates, fresh grapes and more. Isa was a warm and most generous host. Highly recommended. Bonus: the three friendly kittens."
53243,12438300,2015-08-27T14:04:17Z,"Isa is a beyond wonderful and kind host and was so welcoming and helpful to us on our first trip to Puglia. Her Trullo is a dream of a place sat atop a hill in a raw, wild and beautiful landscape surrounded by olive and fig trees and draped in grape vines. We very much enjoyed our stay, Isa was kind enough to collect us from Ostuni station and deliver us at the end to Bari airport, otherwise we would have been stranded! She makes excellent suggestions on all subjects, in particular the best beaches, and where to find local specialities. We thoroughly recommend this Trullo, if you are looking for a remote and beautiful place to catch your breath. We did find, however, that you ideally need a car if you want to explore, which you will want to do! "
53243,34188736,2015-08-14T12:19:46Z,"Isa is a very gracious and generous host who provided us with plenty of information on the surrounding area. The house is a fantastic place to spend a week relaxing.   It has everything you need for a perfect stay.  We loved the town of Cisternino, which is only a 10 minute drive from the house.  For any vegans, we can recommend a little restaurant we came across in Cisternino called Romy and Jole.
Thank you Isa for a wonderful stay!"
53243,13633902,2015-08-07T13:39:33Z,My husband and I spent a week at Isa's trullo.  It is a lovely garden setting with many kinds of fruit trees and vegetables. Isa's hard work really shows.  The house was comfortable and nicely located to Cisternino and Ostuni. I especially liked the very equipped kitchen.  We had a few very very hot days and Isa went to some trouble to get two good fans for us. She also left some of her hosed jam and other goodies for us. A very peaceful setting with a great view of the full moon. 
53243,33668812,2015-07-30T12:38:07Z,"The Trullo was fantastic! 
We loved every minute. It was the perfect home base for our Puglia vacation.  Isa was a lovely host with fantastic suggestions that made us feel like locals -  right at home. 
I HIGHLY RECCOMEND!"
53243,27727491,2015-07-16T12:46:51Z,"Arrivati al tramonto in un trullo ricco di aromi e fascino, siamo stati accolti da una ospite gentile e pronta a rispondere alle nostre domande. Abbiamo trascorso una settimana alla scoperta delle bellezze culturali e culinarie della zona, con momenti di tranquillità assoluta in un trullo arredato con gusto e sapienza. Esperienza da rifare! "
53243,27001350,2015-06-19T11:16:26Z,"Très bon accueil de la part d'Isa avec des produits locaux qui nous attendaient dans la cuisine et qui nous ont permis de dîner et de prendre le petit déjeuner sans avoir à aller faire de courses le jour de notre arrivée. Le trullo est parfait, bien aménagé, bien décoré. L'emplacement est idéal : assez éloigné de la route pour ne pas entendre de voitures, ni de voisins. On peut profiter pleinement des espaces extérieurs en toute sérénité. Et pourtant Ostuni n'est qu'à 10 minutes en voiture ! Un lieu magique que je recommande."

The bathtub, fresh flowers, candles and delicious breakfast were the perfect compliment to the beautiful cave bedroom. Alexis and Lotte were terrific hosts with great recommendations of the area. We enjoyed great food, visited several beautiful château and winery's. They even helped us plan a romantic picnic. We hope to come back one day!!!"

3567278,11669221,2017-04-13T07:57:38Z,Alexis and Lotte's cave house is incredible! Amazing accommodation in a fantastic part of France. They were very welcoming and had great communication to assist us. I literally cannot recommend this enough. Thanks for a great stay!
3567278,25318577,2017-04-12T06:53:27Z,"We had an unbelievable stay in Lotte's and Alexi's place. From the moment we arrived we felt like we were in somewhere magical.  The hosts were so lovely and welcoming, and gave us plenty of recommendations for things to do and food options in near by Amboise and Tours. We had travelled from Paris and the place was such a contrast from the manic-ness of a big city. The breakfast provided with the room was so nice. The walks around the area are beautiful and with a car you can explore the beauty of the Loire Valley. "
3567278,75614940,2017-04-10T07:48:55Z,"My favorite place I've ever stayed. These guys are so stylish, so friendly and so kind! It is truly beautiful, and perfectly situated near amboise. Amazing restaurant Recommendations, breakfast and that bathtub is life changing! Enjoy!"

433392,62018688,2017-04-30T06:19:01Z,It's an amazing place with an awesome view. The place is beautiful was always clean and the lady who looks after the place was always there to help us and she left lovely snacks for us every morning. Highly recommended.
433392,120638480,2017-04-11T08:24:38Z,"Hector House is beautiful and well located.  We were a family of 4, and even my teenage children appreciated that it was special.  They did not want to leave.  The house is beautifully decorated and includes amenities and snacks that made it easy to immediately feel relaxed.  Sunset spots and shops in Oia are just down the stairs, but the apartment feels quiet and private.  Oia is a beautiful town.  Ideal if you want to spend the evening wandering through narrow alleys that are lined with shops and restaurants. Giannis offered great ideas on Santorini activities, and the best souvlaki shop.  Highly recommend the hiking and boat cruise.  Giannis also helped arrange taxi from the airport, so no rental car was needed.  You will enjoy your stay."
433392,30391033,2017-04-09T07:35:55Z,We had a wonderful time at the Hector Cave House!  Giannis's went above and beyond from check in to check out. It was our best experience with Airbnb yet! The house is a minute away from the overlook for sunsets and there are shops and restaurants only minutes away. There was a lot of parking close by too! We were there with a one year old and the house was very accessible (not too many stairs).  The view from the house was unbelievable and the hospitality extended to us made our trip. We would 100% stay here again! 
433392,69301229,2016-11-01T06:45:58Z,"The place is very spacious, centrally located with access to shopping, church square, the wonderful sunset view of Santorini from the old castle and an awesome view of the Sea. 

Giannis is very helpful and guided us very patiently on all the highlights of Santorini to get the local flavor and made our trip very memorable.
His staff were very friendly and helpful as well. He is a super host and I strongly recommend this place to all travelers planning to visit Santorini (Oia).

433392,3407638,2016-10-22T08:46:04Z,"One of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Giannis' beautiful home was one of the big reasons we fell in love with Santorini and totally defined our experience there. I was finally able to relax here! Even though Giannis was not there, he made the experience as welcoming as possible - from having someone carry our luggage during checkin and out to room service cleaning every day - which was a MAJOR unexpected plus! You must stay here if you come to Santorini!"
433392,4924773,2016-10-19T08:45:54Z,"Incredible experience 10/10!

Far and away the best Airbnb experience I've had to date.

Giannis was an excellent host - kind, knowledgeable & accommodating.

To any future travelers staying at the Hector House, listen to all of his recommendations! 

We stayed for 3 nights and explored the majority of the island. Some highlights were the southern beaches (Perivolos & Vlichada), Pyrgos, Ammoudi Bay and cliff diving, plus all the breathtaking views and delicious restaurants in Oia.

The apartment is even better than pictured (hard to believe), but it's true!

Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Santorini!

Thank you again Giannis & Alexandra!!"
433392,14851682,2016-10-16T06:34:59Z,"Giannis Zisimos words cannot express our gratitude for all your kindness and compassion with your Phenomenal Outstanding Accommodations...We absolutely loved your house from the lovely decor to state of the art showers to the warm comfort of love that holds energy in this place...The views are Spectacular and I absolutely loved the outdoor Jacuzzi! Thank you for taking the time to guide us on trips, restaurants, shops, and the necessities needed during our stay! I absolutely recommend contacting Giannis if you are looking to stay in Santorini! He is the absolute best Host who is guanine about making sure you have absolutely everything you need and all is taken care of! I will without a doubt be back and stay a few weeks at his prime location! 
Blessings and Love

433392,62291655,2016-10-15T11:11:57Z,"This place will set a standard for the rest of your travels. It's so well thought out that's it's intuitive. From the placement of the electrical outlets to the wonderful water pressure and higher shower, you will find total comfort.  The view is beyond amazing. The plunge pool is a perfect spot to cool down after a exploring.  Gianni's goes beyond in making sure you are comfortable.  He's just a real nice guy. If you choose here, you've made the right choice.  "
433392,77383940,2016-10-05T05:54:05Z,"We came across Hector Cave House in a Traveller Guide in our Melbourne newspaper - it was an article highlighting how good Airbnb could be, when the host went the extra mile in hospitality. Giannis has created a calm, clean, cleverly designed oasis in the old town of Oia. Set above some shops, overlooking the awe inspiring caldera, you can sit + watch the world go by.  The kitchen had everything we needed (and more - water, juice, coffee, spreads, milk, olive oil, all plates/glasses/cutlery to cook if you so wished), the bed was comfortable, the proximity to restaurants ideal + the view is breathtaking at every hour of the day.  No disruption wifi, great tv with cable, a safety box...and a visit from a neighbourhood cat, made this place like home for us. This is a very special place + whilst we only had three nights - the first night we arrived late from the Mykonos ferry, so some time was lost - it was the perfect end to our European trip.  It is not inexpensive for two, but we believe it was worth the money given the care that has gone into the place. Giannis took care of arrangements for our transfer, luggage movement + introduction to the house (also thanks to Alexandra + Vasili) + was a wonderful, authentic host. Thank you Giannis - what a treasure of an experience you've given us! "
433392,69926238,2016-09-28T06:52:06Z,We enjoyed an absolutely authentic and magical beginning to our honeymoon in Hector's Cave House and thoroughly recommend staying here when in Oia.  Giannis was super helpful and friendly all throughout our stay :)
433392,47669362,2016-09-26T05:44:50Z,"Wow!!! The Hector Cave House is the most incredible place I have ever stayed. An enchanted place. It is just as beautiful if not more stunning than in the photos. Also, what the photos can't capture is the wonderful serenity and quiet you feel in the cave house.

My arrival was so easy and flawless. Giannis arranged a transfer for me and was there to meet me and give me a quick overview of the village and the amenities in the house. He is warm and welcoming but also very organised with great suggestions for things to do and restaurants etc - all round fantastic host! The bottle of wine, cake and spoon sweet was a lovely touch. And so delicious! Also really appreciated the bottles of water and juice.

The location is perfect. A minute's walk to the castle in Oia and close to all the restaurants and shops. Being above the street level you are separate from all the crowds though. The gift shop below is also very cute. The village of Oia is so beautiful - the most perfect place to stay on Santorini. 

I was travelling alone but the house is very spacious with room for 4 people. I loved being there as a solo traveller - very safe, quiet and convenient to everything! After a stressful year it was the most wonderful place to relax. And you can have the views all to yourself!

Everything works well in the house - airconditioning, jacuzzi, power points, hairdryer, daily cleaning etc.

I'm sure Giannis has heard this a hundred times but the only negative about this place is that I had to leave! I hope to return again soon."
433392,11519070,2016-09-19T07:51:25Z,"This was the greatest experience and the highlight of our recent Eurotrip. Hector's Cave is simply magnificent! Spot clean, top of the line appliances, cool even on hot days, beautifully and ingeniously built in an authentic cave (you can see some rocks protruding from walls).  Another plus: The Location! Is located in one of the hottest spots of Oia Village, steps from the best place to experience the famous Santorini Sunset and close to great restaurants and shops.  Hate to give it 5 Star because I am selfish and I always will want to find it available for ourselves.  Giannis is the greatest host, I can see why he is highly rates on the BnB community, very accommodating, always  following up to see if you need something, and Vassilis and Alexandra also very nice people willing to assist you all the time.  Cannot wait to comeback! Thanks Giannis for a magnificent stay!"
433392,8096982,2016-09-14T07:33:16Z,We thorougly enjoyed our stay at Hector villa. Giannis was not there to greet us but he made sure that we were taken care of and he also made himself available for us to contact anytime of the day. The villa was exactly as described and very clean.
433392,18615885,2016-09-06T07:13:02Z,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Giannis totally blew away our expectations. He was very prompt in responding to all of our inquiries before the trip. He even arranged for a shuttle to bring us to Oia after our late arrival at the airport. The shuttle from the airport to the Hector Cave House will take approx 30-40min. Giannis met us and had someone carry our bags to the villa. The villa is in a prime Santorini location, almost the the very northern tip of the village. You are literally a few steps from the castle and amazing sunsets. Giannis had the villa stocked with wine, juices, waters and snacks. We weren't expecting this at all. The actual space was impeccable. Plenty of room for two people, you could actually fit 4 people comfortably. There are two spacious bathroom areas and a kitchenette. The outdoor sun deck and jacuzzi were nice as well. The steps leading up to the villa were clearly a photographers dream. We noticed many people taking pics of our steps as we sum bathed. The villa is very clean and well appointed. Giannis is a great host. He sat with us and reviewed all the activities the island had to offer. He gave us restaurant recommendations that were on point. He also arranged a day sailing trip for us on our final check out day. I was relectuctant to write such an amazing review as the secret is now out of the bag. Awesome experience in Santorini. You will love it. "
433392,54805587,2016-09-02T10:51:31Z,Giannis was the most helpful and kind host. He really made us feel at home and made sure our stay was just perfect! 
433392,79152577,2016-08-29T02:59:44Z,"We had an incredible stay at Hector cave house! The location was perfect, on great street close to main landmarks and great restaurants but easy enough to access, without too many steps. The house was very spacious, super clean, beautifully decorated and equipped with more than a hotel would be (toiletries, iron, hairdryer, drinks, fruit and even snacks!). Most importantly, the host, Giannis, was extremely helpful and accommodating. Could not have asked for a better place! "
433392,69421694,2016-08-17T09:04:25Z,"I echo the rest of the reviews you see here - everything about Giannis and the Hector Cave House was exceptional! I would not hesitate to book it again, and would advise anyone seeking accommodations in Santorini to look no further - this is absolutely the place to stay in Oia to maximize your experience! About Giannis - Giannis is an incredible host who stands out in terms of the thoughtfulness in his hospitality. Before our arrival he was in constant communication, and sent us an extremely detailed list of Santorini attractions, beaches, restaurants, and useful local contact information that helped us plan our daily itinerary for Santorini. For our arrival by ferry, Giannis arranged a transfer van to pick us up at the Fira port and take us directly to Oia. The driver was waiting for us at the port holding a sign with our names, it couldn't have been easier. When we arrived in Oia, Giannis was waiting to meet us with a porter, who saved us the trouble of having to lug our baggage through the town streets, again, easy. When we arrived at the house, Giannis presented us with a bouquet of flowers, a chilled bottle of Assyrtiko wine, and a freshly baked cake - you get the picture. Giannis gave us a warm personal introduction to the house, went over all of the amenities to use, sat us down with a map and went thoroughly took us through all of the attractions we might enjoy. About the Hector Cave House - Location - you are in the nicest part of Oia town, just steps away from the Byzantine Castle, and directly above Ammoudi Bay. The view looks like a postcard, down below you have quick access to restaurants and shops on foot. When we went in early August, we did not have direct view of the sunset from the balcony, but it was viewable just a few steps from the house. If you rent a car, you will be able find parking within 5 minutes walking distance from the house. The neighborhood is touristic with heavy foot traffic down below (especially during sunset viewing hours), but the cave house sits above the pedestrian path on a private tier, it is well separated from the crowds below. You will have great views of the caldera bay from the patio. In terms of location, it really doesn't get much better or more convenient in Oia. The house itself - I would say the photos don't quite do the space proper justice, it is actually much roomier than you might perceive from the listing photos. Giannis has all the kitchen amenities, Nespresso machine, fridge stocked with bottled water and juices daily, etc. The space is clean, stylish and functional. The lofted bed is large and comfortable. There are two nice showers, with good water pressure. The flat is cleaned daily and kept well-maintained by Alexandra, who was very sweet and accommodating as well. Overall this is really a..."
433392,32393055,2016-08-10T01:44:10Z,"Not only were the accommodation and location superb, but Giannis was also an absolutely amazing host!  If your budget allows, then book this place. You will be very happy you did so.  I miss it already."
433392,3698348,2016-08-08T00:40:15Z,"Giannis is an exceptional host & an exceptional person. His apartment is a reflection of him. Exceptional! Situated in the centre of Oia with your own swimming pool, just perfect for visiting this beautiful village. Everything was perfect, it is even better than a 5 star hotel as it is private. Giannis has great taste and the apartment is renovated with high quality material. We are a family of 4 with 2 children and we couldn't recommend it more. Giannis helped us plan our trip, was always available and bent over backwards for us when our boat transfer was cancelled. "

341978,14069437,2017-05-11T10:03:34Z,"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE! Like a 7 * hotel but better. Our suite was like a Morrocon Palace and the Riad itself was beautiful. The furnishings and artwork and artefacts that Reb had collected and displayed around the Riad were perfect. Reb could not have been nicer as was Fatima (who helped and made the most delicious breakfast - which is served in the cool and calm courtyard). 
The place looks unassuming from the street, but once you open the 3000 year old door you enter the most magical, luxurious space. There are 4 rooms but you always feel like you're the only ones there. 
The roof terrace is always sunny and chilled and amazingly quiet considering how central to the chaos of the souk you are.
Our room (shown in the photo) was out of this world. A beautiful original mosaic ceiling. A huge stunning polished plaster bath. A reading area and a seperate connecting room, that we used as a changing room, but is great as a children's room.
Reb was so friendly and interesting and made us feel completely at home. We are definitely coming back, even if just to say hello to the little turtle who lives in the courtyard (if we can find her again). You will not be disappointed."
341978,109771250,2017-05-09T09:12:46Z,"Gorgeous Riad, central location, walking distance to all sights. Quiet and relaxing at night & excellent hospitality. Would recommend without reservation. Have stayed here twice. "
341978,118339193,2017-04-29T13:42:27Z,Very nice. Excepting the breakfast that was almost nothing. 
341978,82426110,2017-04-28T10:13:02Z,"Sono appena tornata dopo aver passato circa 4 giorni presso l'alloggio di Reb. La stanza era stupenda, fedele alle foto, molto pulita, con tutti i comfort e silenziosa. Abbiamo apprezzato molto anche la posizione del riad e la gradevole colazione preparata sul momento ogni mattina!
Reb è una persona gentilissima e disponibile (il mio ragazzo si è sentito poco bene e lui ha provveduto ad andare in farmacia per noi e farci trovare le medicine)! 
Tornerò sicuramente! "
341978,32774195,2017-04-24T15:05:03Z,"What an amazing place to stay! The decor, the ambiance, the location. I only wish I could have booked longer in advance to have stayed at this place several nights! "
341978,51064743,2017-04-23T09:51:51Z,Riad fantastico. 5 stelle. Persone altrettanto disponibili e gentili.
341978,1614840,2017-04-12T07:06:27Z,"Nuestra habitacion era espectacular y el personal muy amable. Muy bien situado, cerca de la plaza."
341978,46398389,2017-04-04T09:44:41Z,"I would highly recommend this Riad to anyone.   We stayed in this 'room' with our two boys and there was plenty of space.  The main bedroom is connected to two smaller rooms as well as a spacious bathroom.
The hosts made everything so easy. The communication before arrival was very fast & efficient. They arranged a driver to collect us from the airport and deliver us to the Riad. Our room was more magnificent than those in some of the museums we visited! Elegantly decorated with some fascinating art and artefacts, the Riad was a perfect oasis of calm, just a minutes walk from the mayhem of the Medina. 
Enjoyed our breakfast in the courtyard each morning but the evening meal on the terrace was a real highlight. 
Really can't fault it in any way 
Thank you, we loved it. 
"
341978,85248806,2017-03-31T07:10:41Z,"Based on the reviews and pictures seen before our trip we had very high expectations - even these were truly exceeded! The hosts, Reb, Matteo and Alberto, were all extremely helpful and generous, which complimented the fantastic riad and its setting - a relaxing retreat just a stones throw away from the hustle and bustle of the medina. I would recommend this riad to anyone wanting to experience Marrakech."
341978,109385294,2017-03-24T08:53:37Z,"Enjoyed our family stay at the riad very much. We arranged for an airport pickup which was on time and courteous. The riad is centrally located on a residential alley in the heart of the souks, five minutes from Jeema el-Fna square. The riad is well appointed with traditional Morrocan architecture and other African tribal art. Alberto, our warm host, was very helpful in orienting us to the city and can arrange tours and restaurant reservations. We enjoyed breakfast in the riad courtyard, and relaxing on the rooftop patio listening to the call to prayer echo over the city was a fine way to end the day. We recommend the riad as your oasis in the heart of the Medina. "
341978,77303960,2017-03-20T08:43:17Z,"Fabulous, wonderful, the best. Perfect location and staff so helpful and so nice. We felt at home in the Riad, it is intimate a cozy in the middle of the Medina. Anything you need the staff can organize. Great excursion, delicious and sophisticated dinner at the Riad for a very fair price. A Riad in the Medina is the only way to go in Marrakech and this one is gorgeous and welcoming and in the middle of where you want to be. 

Absolument fabuleux.  Location parfait.  On a passé une magnifique séjour. À la Riad on était bien, on se senti à la maison. En plus le style est traditionnel et magnifique. Alberto, Matteo et Ahmed sont très gentil et prêt à tout organizer pour les guests. Tous que vous à besoin ils sont la.  Dîner à la Riad c'était raffiné et délicieux pour un très bon prix.  Merci beaucoup "
341978,9639741,2017-03-17T10:45:37Z,"Matteo, Alberto and Reb were a trio of very friendly and helpful hosts. We had a really nice stay in the Bamileke suite which is spacious, airy and decorated with artifacts. 

Breakfasts were efficient and tasty. One evening, the kitchen staff prepared us a feast of multiple tagines and our hosts' flare for hospitality was apparent as they rounded out the dinner with aperitifs, yummy crudités, wine and dessert. 

They were also helpful in booking us a hammam/massage afternoon at the Hammam Isis just around the corner. 

The riad is down a quiet side street just a short walk to Jemaa el Fnaa and super access to the Marrakech souks. Highly recommend the restaurant Chez Brahim right around the corner for a well priced and generous meal. 

Thanks again Matteo, Alberto and Reb for a great stay in Marrakech!!!"
341978,9999939,2017-03-11T08:51:10Z,"Matteo was helpful throughout the pickup/check in process and available on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). The place is palatial, traditional Moroccan design, and big especially for just me. It is a great suite, complete with Rose petals on the pillow, big bed, and skylight. It felt fairly safe for being in the bustling medina near markets, despite walking down the dark alleyway on later nights. Having a nightguard helps and he was very nice, same guy who picked me up and dropped me off in the medina to/from the airport. Breakfast is small so don't expect much beyond a juice, coffee, crossiant, and bread. I only had it once because my tours were earlier in the day. "
341978,80490842,2017-03-06T08:12:57Z,Everything as described and very professional throughout. Thanks so much for a great weekend! 
341978,10934207,2017-03-02T10:19:17Z,Awesome riad. 
341978,17491967,2017-02-27T10:09:13Z,"We enjoyed Riad Bamileke and Marrakech. The location is perfect. The stuff is friendly. Very safe and relaxing place with a possibility to order very tasty food and vine (75Eur for two with a bottle of vine)
They organize tours as well what is helpful if you do not like to do it yourself in a street tourist offices.
Recommend it!"
341978,34660274,2017-02-14T12:00:37Z,"The staff: Alberto, Mateo and Ahmed were amazing and so kind.  They helped out with everything we needed and they were so easily reachable.  
Location/place: I would highly recommend this place to everyone and I cant wait to come back!!!  It was easy to find, and so close to everything.  The Riad was also exceptional and so cool."
341978,14403673,2017-02-10T11:58:15Z,"Go for it! What a find! We booked the 100sq ft suite. Beautiful. Bedroom was large, great bed and beautiful authentic furnishings. Lovely bathroom. Extra room. It could accommodate more than 2 easily, but we were only 2 and loved the space. Breakfast was great. It's five minutes stroll from the main square and right in the middle of things. Neighbours were interested in us and everybody was so kind and generous. Stupid me left my bag in the pick up taxi but everybody went out of their way to reunite me with it as soon as possible. Everything was safe. The area is family friendly and very safe, close to shops, restaurants and the night life around the square. Honestly, you won't be disappointed. Great communication from Reb and Alberto, the manager, couldn't have been more useful. Quiet at night ensure you get good sleep. "
341978,12317715,2017-02-06T11:50:30Z,"Riad Bamileke is a great place to stay- so central, but so quiet and calm. Our room was spacious and beautiful. Alberto gave us lots of information about Marrakesh on arrival, which really helped us find our way. We also had one evening meal at the riad-3 courses including a delicious tagine. The airport transfer also made our arrival and departure really smooth. We loved our time there and would definitely go back!"
341978,102711083,2017-02-03T11:18:24Z,La mejor habitación de Marrakech. 
272282,76748466,2017-05-09T11:01:29Z,"Excelente  estancia tuvimos en el departamento de Mar,tiene todo lo necesario para que así sean,es un lujo y está cerca de todos los transportes . Los padres de Mar son un amor de personas, nos explicaron como era el funcionamiento de todo el departamento muy amablemente.  Gracias a los tres. Besos"
272282,110342021,2017-05-06T06:06:39Z,"We had a very great time at Mar's place. The apartment is spacious, clean, well decorated and located in a perfect neighbourhood. It is close to the metro and to everything you may need. The only negative point was the noise coming from the street in the two bedrooms located in the front of the apartment. That being said, we had a great stay and enjoyed the city very much. In addition, Mar's parents were absolutely charming when they welcomed us on the first day. Thanks for everything. "
272282,279176,2017-04-28T07:43:17Z,"We adored Mar's apartment. It's lovely and located in a fun residential area that has lots of cafes, small shops, etc. It's very centrally located to all the main attractions but quiet enough for families who want some calm. Absolutely recommend it; it was one of our all-time favorite stays!"
272282,10897826,2017-04-23T07:37:25Z,"A great place to stay. Stayed for two weeks wiry our kids and mother in law. Perfectly located. All amenities you could need! Clean, comfortable and very spacious. Beautiful decor with tons of books."

The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with dishes and utensils.  Mar was a gracious host - responsive with any questions and very accommodating when we had to delay our departure a few hours.  I strongly recommend this place to everyone.
272282,63614947,2017-04-02T08:15:37Z,"Mar's apartment is just as advertised: bright, clean, cozy, and convenient.

Her parents welcomed us when we arrived at the apartment and set the tone for a great week in Barcelona!"
272282,24340013,2017-03-27T08:32:20Z,"Stayed here for a week with young family.  The apartment is well kept and in a safe neighborhood, close to the major sights and most of the city.  Everything was as we expected, we enjoyed the place very much.  "
272282,74108104,2017-03-16T08:19:06Z,"Great location! The apartment itself is perfect, even better than the photos. Very comfortable. We really enjoyed our trip to Barcelona with the help of Mar's great apartment."
272282,98744941,2017-03-05T10:17:54Z,Wonderful apartment containing everything you might need.    Exceptionally comfortable beds with a very efficient shower in the main bedroom. 
272282,5342192,2017-03-03T00:48:51Z,"This is a great place. Well located in the heart of Barcelona and within short distance of many shops and local bars. The house itself is impeccable clean, roomy and has all the necessary amenities. I would recommend this for a large family or company retreat. "
272282,60628968,2017-02-24T08:11:32Z,"The apartment is exactly as advertised.  Great communication before and throughout with Mar.  Great location and easy to get anywhere in the city.  Very comfortable, clean and a great modern kitchen.  I will definitely stay here again when I come back."
272282,43845103,2017-02-09T08:01:31Z,"Una casa espectacular, Mar y sus padres anfitriones perfectos, todo facilidades, cortesía y amabilidad. Cinco estrellas en todos los aspectos. Volveremos pronto, sin ninguna duda."
272282,8359519,2017-01-29T07:22:56Z,"Mar's place is amazing. The flat is beautiful and the location is amazing, from one hand you can feel like you are local and on the other you are very close to everything Barcelona has to offer. 

The place was super clean, Mar recommendations were amazing. 

I highly recommend staying in Mar's flat. "
272282,308795,2017-01-25T08:13:53Z,Mar's place was wonderful! Very clean and spacious. Close walk to lots of cafes and restaurants. Cool neighborhood. Easy and great communication. Definitely would recommend to anyone traveling to Barcelona!

Kitchen well equipped and styled interior.
We stayed with 5 18-year old girls and it was excellent"
272282,46889119,2017-01-10T09:55:52Z,"Apartamento incrível!
Localização excelente, bem perto de muitos dos lugares que queríamos visitar, metrô na mesma quadra, restaurantes por perto (indicação carinhosa para o indiano Namastê), farmacia, mercado (indico o Veritas, mercado de orgânicos super completo), há 20 minutos a pé da Plaça Catalunya.
O ap é bem iluminado, aconchegante, perfeito pra viver feliz e contente um day off.
Estávamos em 4 adultos e 3 crianças (9, 8 e 2 anos) e ficamos muito bem instalados. 
A rua é movimentada e mesmo de noite não é silenciosa, mas para ter as facilidades de uma localização tão privilegiada, não tem como fugir do sons da cidade.
Mar foi muito atenciosa em todas as etapas e não tivemos nenhum contratempo na nossa estada.
Quer conhecer Barcelona com a sensação de voltar pra casa no fim do dia? Esse é o lugar perfeito!
"
272282,46650790,2017-01-03T08:08:45Z,A wonderful apartment in a fantastic location. Mar is a great host. Definitely recommend for a stay in Barcelona! 5*

272282,100061386,2016-12-21T09:32:16Z,Mar was really helpful and kept in touch through whole process. Great location for easy walking and transport links although there was traffic noise in couple of bedrooms
272282,7991201,2016-12-06T08:39:51Z,"Mar's place was truly a haven and beautiful to boot. The space was clean, communication with Mar was easy, and the location was perfect for us. We were able to walk everywhere from the apartment and loved coming home to a quiet and charming space. It is beautifully designed and so spacious. One of the best airbnbs we've stayed in so far. We didn't get to meet Mar in person, but her parents were there to greet us. They were the sweetest!!! Thank you for a great stay, Mar!"
2311466,2592687,2017-04-30T16:24:01Z,Clean bathrooms and well stocked kitchen.  
2311466,21176270,2017-04-28T18:40:27Z,"Awesome place to stay , esp when traveling with family and kids. They have a pretty sweet stack of books, games and movies. "
2311466,99262402,2017-04-23T18:52:26Z,Cabin was great for a weekend get away with friends ! Nice and cozy cabin. Large Table inside of house seats about 10 comfortably. Outside deck is also nice and relaxing as well. Check in was very easy and communication is great between host. I recommend this cabin for a nice get away ! 
2311466,122270080,2017-04-18T15:49:22Z,"This cabin is everything you would expect and so much more. There was so many extras, we had everything we needed. The kitchen is fully stocked, dishes, pans, utensils. The home is beautiful! Plenty of space and room, super cozy. We had the perfect family get away! We even had Easter dinner at the cabin. Everything was perfect! We would love to stay again! "
2311466,43189813,2017-04-16T16:24:14Z,Beautiful cabin in a beautiful location. Would definitely return.
2311466,36155193,2017-04-14T18:42:08Z,.
2311466,103913231,2017-04-11T15:42:38Z,Great time cute house definitely recommend it to my friends 
2311466,96831357,2017-04-05T16:17:56Z,Great place!
2311466,8605449,2017-04-03T15:10:11Z,"The chalet was a great base for enjoying the snow in 50+ degree weather. It gave our two families a place to rest, relax and recuperate between snow play. Checkout was really easy without too many cleaning responsibilities placed on us!"
2311466,49022719,2017-04-01T16:04:00Z,"The cabin is beautifully decorated and makes you feel at home in the mountains! It is a short drive to Heavenly Ski Resort and to the casinos, etc. but also has the benefit of being quiet and secluded! Would definitely recommend staying here to visit Tahoe."
2311466,58273658,2017-03-24T15:13:26Z,"I'll start with the positive...the location is great, my kids went sledding right across the street and had great snowball fights.  The log cabin look is appealing and the dining room table is super cool.  However, the pictures make the house look much bigger and newer than it is. The doors to the bedrooms and bathrooms are cheap particle board that are bending and breaking. The bedrooms are tiny, the master bath is even tinier.  We contacted the owners immediately about the uncleanliness of the house and they responded immediately.  They were willing to have the housekeeper come back and clean again for us.  We declined because we had all of our stuff unpacked and snow gear out.  So I would say the communication is awesome.  This place just wasn't for us.  Next time I'll spend more for a house more upscale. "
2311466,63106449,2017-03-20T15:54:11Z,"Overall, our stay at Ryan & Darnie's Lake Tahoe Chalet was fantastic. The cabin was exactly what our group was looking for in a winter getaway. The cabin was cozy, stocked with firewood, and they provided space heaters for the bedrooms. "
2311466,88236233,2017-03-16T18:41:12Z,"Home is cozy, photos really make the home appear bigger. Living room and dinning table are a little crowded. Home needed some spring cleaning and TLC."
2311466,33523499,2017-03-12T19:00:04Z,Ryan and Darnie were fantastic hosts. They were very responsive and accommodating. Their home is gorgeous and right across from stunning views of beautiful snowy mountains. It was certainly the perfect place to call home-base during our trip up to South Lake Tahoe!
2311466,98861149,2017-03-08T19:28:14Z,Perfect place for a relaxed vacation. Ten minute drive to the village. Check in was quick and easy. The house was decorated perfectly! Definitely visiting again.
2311466,7213600,2017-03-04T17:56:06Z,"We had a wonderful stay during a family ski trip to South Lake. Great location to get to Heavenly, stores and restaurants and the house was cozy and well-equipped. Perfect for apres-ski relaxing and family dinners. Ryan and Darnie were communicative and responsive. Highly recommend and hope to return!"
2311466,23577919,2017-02-27T18:20:29Z,Great place! Helpful hosts. Close to Sierra-at-Tahoe and Heavenly. 
2311466,1161001,2017-02-21T00:50:57Z,"This cabin is more than we expected. It was in the perfect spot for our Winter vacation. It is about 20 minutes from state line and about 25 minutes from Sierra at Tahoe ski resort.

The cabin was fully stocked with dishes, linens, blankets and towels. We even asked if we could have the code for the laundry room to dry some things from skiing, and the hosts responded quickly! I loved how the living room and kitchen are setup for entertaining. Our group of 8 fit comfortably! I would return to this cabin again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend!"
2311466,41575193,2017-02-14T19:56:45Z,We had wonderful time overall! Ryan and Darnie's cabin was and had everything we needed for our stay. We would love to stay again!
2311466,11877652,2017-02-12T19:00:05Z,"Ryan and Darnie's communication was above and beyond. They accommodated our date change so easily and quickly when I booked the wrong weekend. They also checked in on us to make sure we made it safely when they heard the road conditions weren't good. Checking in and out was super easy. We really enjoyed the beautiful cabin, our stay was amazing. The cabin was fully stocked with everything we needed and more. We were also able to play in the snow across the street and took short walks around the neighborhood. It's a short 25 minute drive to Sierra for snowboarding/skiing. Great location and great price. We'll definitely be back!"
3263279,120089765,2017-05-02T16:59:26Z,Chandler is a fantastic host. He is very accomadating and makes sure that you have what you need to have a great time visiting the area. His two dogs are adorable and welcoming. From the moment we arrived we enjoyed the place. It was much better than the pictures.  We were able to relax and enjoy the beautiful tower. Thank you. 
3263279,41056602,2017-04-28T15:05:33Z,"The tower is situated on a hill overlooking a beautiful valley. One of the nicest panoramas I have ever seen from bed. The ""compound"" that the tower is situated in is definitely rural and feels somewhat improvised. Besides the bed, there is little room for much else inside the tower, so hope for good weather.  I strongly suggest that you spend an entire day on the deck/overlook. What a beautiful place to have a cocktail/play cards/listen to music. We spent hours just taking it all in. Chandler is an outgoing and very kind host.  "
3263279,66499603,2017-04-26T23:02:34Z,Chandler is very helpful and has many suggestions about hiking and dining in Carmel Valley.
3263279,11856722,2017-04-25T17:46:32Z,A fantastic place to stay! Beautiful view and very peaceful! Great host who gave great advice and fun to talk to. Can definitely recommend!
3263279,114554107,2017-04-22T15:58:31Z,We enjoyed our stay! The location was gorgeous. Chandler was very helpful and friendly. 
3263279,25282581,2017-04-20T16:27:54Z,"The tower is set in a lovely and unique landscape. Potential guests should know that the bathroom is about 100 feet the tower, up a little path that connects to a barn.  Guests should also know that the second floor of the Tower is not available, leaving a tiny space to maneuver around the queen bed on the first floor.  For the price, ($220/night with fees included) I expected more of a luxury glamping experience, but found that the tower,  its surrounding gardens and garden furniture needed polish and some TLC.  The tower was generally clean, but not immaculate.  Chandler was very friendly and communicative. We enjoyed our stay, but wouldn't be tempted to stay there again.  "
3263279,37429353,2017-04-18T16:25:59Z,"Chandler's tower retreat is quirky, cozy and all-around amazing for a short stay. The space was tidy, peaceful and the view is picturesque beyond words. Chandler was a wonderful host, he made sure we had everything that we needed for our evening. He also had great advice for visiting the surrounding area. We would definitely stay here again."

3263279,115449388,2017-04-14T15:42:49Z,"The view is indescribable. Chandler was so nice that we felt like we were visiting relatives. The air was fresh, the sounds of waterfall, trees, birds when we were lying on the comfy bed in the tower ... peaceful. Thanks Chandler!!"
3263279,63615671,2017-04-11T18:38:29Z,Chandler was very accommodating. Local power outage happened while there and he kept us up to date and worked with power company to get it restored ASAP. Above and beyond effort by him to make sure we were comfortable. Views are great! Great place for a quaint escape!
3263279,16622615,2017-04-10T18:18:09Z,Chandler 's place is really (URL HIDDEN) was just what we needed it. i will definitly come back there.
3263279,35608904,2017-04-08T16:13:47Z,It's a very nice place. The host is a very kind gentleman. Very private with an amazing view. 
3263279,122190832,2017-04-07T18:13:18Z,"Wonderous! I felt incredibly welcomed to stay over at the Tower. Tiger, the property owner, was a pleasure to talk to and he gave very informative and fun suggestions for sightseeing and dinner. Beautiful location overlooking the valley with the ocean breeze coming over the distinct hill. He has two happy dogs and a very handsome horse. I definitely recommend the Tower as place to find a peaceful quiet retreat with nature's refreshing sweetness. "
3263279,118288310,2017-04-05T18:06:50Z,Very beautiful place with really nice views and an overall relaxing vibe. We will be going back for sure.

He gave wonderful recommendations for food and what to see. Had one of a kind views. Would absolutely recommend.
3263279,88464528,2017-04-03T01:20:43Z,"Very inspiring and restful location. Bed is extremely comfortable! Short walk to the bathroom was no problem - would definitely stay here again. The lounge chairs are perfect for sipping wine and watching the sunset. NOTE: If you want a less touristy experience, drive down Rt 1 towards Big Sur. Absolutely stunning! "
3263279,49385302,2017-03-31T15:33:49Z,"My girlfriend and I stayed for one night in the Tower and it was fantastic! So peaceful. So relaxing. The views from the tower were breathtaking. Chandler was very kind and informative about the area and was there if we needed him. His dogs are friendly, too. We will definitely be back! Thank you, again!"
3263279,110359745,2017-03-30T15:04:13Z,"Chandler is a great host, very inviting, friendly, honest, and a good communicator. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet scenic getaway with a view! "

676006,37808745,2017-03-23T07:54:36Z,Bea  and Frans garden room is so tranquil and relaxing. We loved Ermelo and enjoyed cycling in the woods. Such a beautiful place and we plan to come again. 
676006,22454363,2017-02-27T10:41:45Z,Wonderful little hideaway! I highly recommend it and felt so welcomed by Be a and Frans. I arrived much later as I had to work unexpectedly and they were so understanding. I also had to leave a day early due to an emergency and they unnecessarily but ever so kindly refunded the rest of my stay in cash. All I can say is I‘ll be back!
676006,50876397,2016-10-16T08:23:44Z,Bea en Frans hebben ons zeer goed verwelkomd tijdens het lange weekendje weg. De fotos zijn waarheidsgetrouw en geven een goed beeld van het verblijf. Mochten we weer in Ermelo zijn om te overnachten zullen we zeker weer kijken of dit huisje beschikbaar is!
676006,95397259,2016-10-03T08:30:38Z,Prima locatie!
676006,88920220,2016-09-04T06:38:17Z,It is a wonderful journey. Bea and Frans are very nice and kind people. The garden room is just like the photo showed. It is very cozy and beautiful. We can see the star from the room. My husband and I really like it.
676006,38251378,2016-08-13T06:30:36Z,"Ein sehr süßes Gartenhaus, für einen Kurzaufenthalt sehr zu empfehlen, mit sehr freundlichen Gastgebern. "
676006,59425769,2016-02-28T22:09:07Z,"Ik werd prettig welkom geheten door Frans en Bea. Jullie easy-going mentaliteit was erg prettig. Alles was piekfijn in orde. Handdoeken en shampoo stond al klaar. 
Het geur van het hout in het tuinhuis was erg fijn en het uitzicht fantastisch door de vele ramen. 
Het zit op loopafstand van het centrum van Ermelo en dat vond ik erg prettig. Ik kreeg zonder moeite een fiets van ze mee om de omgeving te verkennen.
Wat ik speciaal vond was dat het eenvoudig was (koud stromend water, open haard, vanuit bed kijkend naar de sterren) en toch voelde het als luxe (elektrische kachel, waterkoker, thee en koffie stond klaar). 
Heel erg bedankt voor jullie bijzondere tuinhuis! "
676006,41318082,2015-08-31T18:28:54Z,"We are very happy about the time that we were able to spend in Bea's and Frans' little cosy cabin. For us it has been the most attractive stay in the Netherlands. We had hoped to find some relaxation and actually found a piece of paradise. You have a wonderful garden full of flowers and a little brook burbling along the cabin - the perfect romantic idyll for a couple in love. We always felt safe and sound and unobserved in spite of the big windows. On the contrary - we enjoyed the beautiful sun and moon-view and the spectecular garden surrounding the cabin. The oven gave us a feeling of cosiness on highest level. You as hosts were very friendly, discrete and well organised. Thank you very much for opening your special garden house for us. And thank you as well for offering us your bikes. So we could discover the region around Ermelo - such as the Heideland and its honey scent. "
676006,26203306,2015-08-17T17:21:18Z,"We stayed in their garden room for two days and we loved it! It's very cozy and pretty in the inside as well as the outside. Bea and Frans provided us with everything that we needed. If it wasn't for the morning light that comes in, I could totally live there! I would recommend this accommodation to anyone who's looking for a relaxing and comfortable stay."
676006,40146721,2015-08-09T18:32:11Z,Our stay at the charming garden room was a very pleasant experience. Bea and Frans gave us a warm welcome and surprised us with a beautiful bunch of flowers out of their own garden. The room is very cosy with a lot of sweet and surprising details. Everything was as descripted in the profile and very comfortable. The atmosphere of the garden was beautiful. Our hosts were also very helpful with information about the area. We really enjoyed our stay.
676006,22863697,2015-07-14T11:23:10Z,Bea & Frans were away when we stayed so their daughter was there and was the perfect host! Amazing meals and awesome laid back atmosphere. The cabin itself was so lovely and cozy - the wood stove inside was the cherry on top. Would 100% recommend staying here and would love to come back! Thanks so much! 
676006,37581022,2015-07-12T16:52:51Z,"Erg mooie ruimte in een prachtige tuin.
Bea en Frans ontvingen ons heel hartelijk, we hebben ons echt gast gevoeld.
Lekker bed en heel sfeervol ingericht.
Zondag heerlijk ontbijtje door dochter Ivanka."
676006,25516192,2015-06-06T12:24:31Z,"It was a really unique airbnb experience! The wooden cabin was cosy and comfortable. The best part was waking up with the garden view, and you can hear the chickens and birds outside. It was beautiful! 
Just slight inconvenience that we had to go out of the cabin to shower. But they provide a small chemical toilet if you need to use the toilet at night. 

Beas and Frans were very friendly and helpful. They made our stay very enjoyable. "
676006,31067451,2015-05-16T14:41:30Z,"Wir sind am Samstag früh morgens angekommen und wollten unser Gepäck ablegen, um entspannt in den Tag starten zu können.
Die Unterkunft liegt inmitten einer sehr ansprechenden Wohnsiedlung. Schon bei der Ankunft hatten wir ein sehr gutes Gefühl.
Bea und Frans haben uns wirklich sehr nett und völlig frei empfangen. Der Weg in den sehr schön angelegten Garten war mal ganz was anderes als der Gang durch ein Hotelgang zum Zimmer irgendwo hinten links oder so... 
Der Holzbungalow wirkt noch viel gemütlicher als auf dem Foto. Alles sehr schön ansprechend. Wir haben uns schon morgens auf unseren ersten Abend gefreut. 
Die Nutzung der Toilette direkt am Eingang des Wohnhauses und das Bad im Obergeschoss des Hauses waren selbstverständlich und  ansprechend. 
Da es Tagsüber erst noch sehr kalt war, hatten wir ein wenig Bedenken ob es denn Nachts auch warm genug im Gartenhaus sei. 
Doch die Bedenken waren völlig umsonst. Durch die Sonne am Nachmittag konnte sich der Raum durch die schön großen Glasflächen gut erwärmen. Und bei einem Glas Wein und dem kleinen, aber sehr schönen Kamin hatten wir in ein paar Minuten so eine Wärme, dass wir schon die hintere Tür zum Lüften geöffnet haben .
Morgens stand ein Teller mit frischen Obst vor der Tür, worüber wir uns sehr gefreut haben. 
Bea und Frans, euch ein ganz großes Lob!  Sowohl eure Freundlichkeit als auch den Geschmack des wunderschön angelegten Gartens und der Einrichtung sind einfach vorbildlich.
Wir hätten gerne mehr Zeit dort verbracht.. 
Und wir kommen gerne wieder...
Beste Grüße, 
Ramona und Wolfgang"
676006,31357767,2015-05-08T14:48:30Z,Bea and Frans were very warm and welcoming. They were helpful about answering our questions before our arrival.
676006,24539640,2015-04-21T14:00:05Z,"So amazing experience! Thank you very much! If I will visit Netherlands again, I will book this room again!!"
676006,8376721,2015-04-03T13:46:17Z,"Wat heb ik heerlijk 5 dagen kunnen schrijven aan mijn boek in dit geweldige tuinhuis. Lekker compact en toch ruim, warme sfeer, goed bed, fijn bureau met goede bureaustoel en WIFI en ook nog een gezellige houtkachel. Je zit in de bewoonde wereld en toch hoor je de vogeltjes, het ruisen van de bomen en ziet door het glazen dak de lucht en 's nachts de sterren. Aanrader!

Frans en Bea zijn zeer gastvrij maar laten je ook op een hele ontspannen manier lekker je eigen gang gaan. "
676006,13553051,2015-03-28T13:24:51Z,"It was a great experience to live in the wood house, so beautiful and romantic!! The transportion is also very convenience. It is so special memory:) Thanks Bea and Frans to hold us:) "
676006,14167327,2014-11-11T13:24:17Z,"This has been the best experience I've had so far since I've discovered Airbnb. Bea and Frans are amazing hosts and the gardenroom was exactly as described. We had no problem whatsoever and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of peace and quiet with a romantice fireplace. Oh, the fireplace.... I shall miss it so!
Thank you and looking forward to staying there again in the near future! Greetings to the chickens!"
676006,2656298,2014-06-23T12:40:01Z,"We really enjoyed this vacation!
Bea & Frans absolutely are such awesome people!
we loved everything! the gardenroom is simply beautiful and the bed is very very comfortable. the beach in ermelo isnt too far. so this is the perfect range for a vacation. We also loved the little suprise breakfast by Bea&Frans! This was so cute (:

from the bottom of our hearts. thank you so much for this perfect vacation!
Be blessed!

493845,43793890,2017-04-23T08:32:37Z,"Nous avons séjourné avec nos deux grands enfants dans le superbe et paisible riad Dar'awach. L'accueil est chaleureux.
Merci à Françoise, Sabah et Fayssal d'avoir rendu ce séjour inoubliable.
Nous le recommandons vivement.
"
493845,118406507,2017-04-14T09:27:07Z,The Riad is lovely with beautiful architectural detailing and furnishings throughout. Sabah welcomed us where the driver dropped us off and made our check in stress free. She  is a lovely woman with a very big heart and meeting her was a big factor in our family's wonderful experience in Marrakech. We also felt very secure walking home in the late evenings being accompanied by a security guard in the dark streets of the Medina.
493845,29169973,2017-03-31T08:56:59Z,Beautiful riad in a great location. We greatly enjoyed our time here. 
493845,20696967,2017-03-26T07:46:13Z,"We had such a wonderful time in Marrakech.  The riad was perfect for two couples and a great location for access to everything in the Medina.  Arranged through the riad, a driver picked us up at the airport and took care driving us for the weekend, including arranging a camel ride!  Very clean and a great roof terrace.  We would recommend this to anyone."
493845,5715812,2017-03-23T08:36:54Z,"Françoise's riad is beautiful! I was with three other friends and its was spacious with amazing decor and a lovely terrace. It is exactly as pictured in the photos and conveniently located for exploring the medina. Faysal the driver who picked us up from the airport was prompt, professional and helpful. Saba the housekeeper was very sweet and welcomed us with tea. I would recommend this place to anyone. "
493845,46700037,2017-03-21T04:19:39Z,"Relaxing and amazing escape tucked in a side street in the center of it all! Highly recommend this riad to anyone looking for a place in Marrakesh ! Clean, quiet, perfect location, GORGEOUS, and Sabah the housekeeper is so warm and amazing! She cooked us a delicious breakfast the first day and made sure we felt at home every day! The souk can be hectic and this place is a perfect escape- walking distance from it all! Thank you so much for our beautiful stay in Marrakesh ! We will definitely be back! "
493845,18692332,2017-03-14T10:58:22Z,"Truly a stunning home - between the rooftop terrace and the riad-style pool, we could barely tear ourselves away from the house to go explore the city. The location was great - walkable to everything we were interested in seeing and doing in Marrakesh. I traveled with my best friend, and as two young women traveling alone, we felt very safe in Françoise's Airbnb. There is even a security guard to escort you safely to your door should you return home after dark. There were good restaurants nearby, as well as a currency exchange business. Sabah the housekeeper and Fayssal the driver were both incredibly kind and professional. We truly couldn't have asked for a better experience. I loved Morocco and this listing so much that I'm already trying to plan a return trip with my husband (and I haven't even made it back home yet). "
493845,48449071,2017-02-23T10:11:15Z,"Unbelievable!  Beautiful home (yes, you really DO borrow the ENTIRE three sorry riad for yourself...) located right at the top of the souks & not many meters from the police station, extremely nice and helpful host, and...Sabbah - not ""just"" a housekeeper, but the warmest welcome I've ever received in any country I've ever been, a fantastic cook, and more!
There are many lodging options in Marrakech, but this is the one I know I will use every time I am in this part of the world."
493845,23184282,2017-02-18T09:20:09Z,"Les 3 jours passés dans ce bijou de Riad étaient beaucoup trop courts: Les petits-déjeuners pris sur la terrasse (en février!) avec vue sur les toits de la vieille ville, la cuisine marocaine délicieuse de Sabah (plusieurs menus à choix qu'on peut commander la veille) avec son sourire chalheureux et son thé à la menthe inimitable,  une excursion dans la vallée de l'Ourika (très touristique!) avec Fayçal, le chauffeur toujours prêt à organiser quoi que ce soit (un guide pour la visite de la ville dans la bonne langue, une excursion « sur mesure »etc.), le pain frais du boulanger juste au coin de la ruelle, les odeurs, les couleurs, qu'on ne peut pas décrire, il faut le vivre.
On y reviendra - avec une valise vide pour toutes les belles choses qu'on auraient aimé acheter au marché."
493845,30509749,2017-02-12T10:50:57Z,Lovely place. As depicted in the pictures. Loved the city and the feel of the area. Rooms are well heated with separate heaters provided for each room. Marrakech is a mystical place and Francoise's home made it even more special. 
493845,24555076,2017-01-30T10:26:05Z,"très agréable riad en plein coeur de la médina: calme, confortable, idéal pour découvrir Marrakech"
493845,20216110,2017-01-21T10:51:48Z,"The riad is lovely, a little more worn that photos express, although isn't that always the case? 

We stayed here in January - and this has nothing to do with the riad itself - it wasn't as warm as we'd hoped - and we were not able to enjoy the openness of the space. We only had one brief afternoon on the roof terrace.

I can easily imagine this house in warmer weather as being absolutely fantastic. There is heat, though, but that means closing the doors to be in the smaller spaces.

We enjoyed buying bread at the bakery close by (totally traditional experience) and making breakfast in the morning before hitting the streets. (that's another story altogether)!

The best thing about this riad is the LOCATION. If you want to be in the medina, the souks are close by - and you are close to the Dar el-Bach - street and intersection where there are taxi stands (landmark to find your way). Learn the name of this street/area so when you get lost - and you will - you can use it for reference. Otherwise people on the streets will try to direct you to the Jaama El-fna or somewhere they want you to buy something. I'll post about Marrakech on trip advisor.

If you are thinking you might do something important that involves WIFI, please know that internet connection in the medina is very slow. My understanding is that it is not just this house, but the medina in general.

In conclusion for the price and location the amount of space you get is great.
"
493845,70033970,2017-01-12T11:36:01Z,"We Stayed there, it liked a dream and we didn't want to get up and left this place. We arrived at Marrakech Airport, taxi driver collected and dropped us to the main street which was very close to where we stayed. It is only 15-20 mins from airport to main street and another 5 mins walk to the this place. It had a local minimart that we found quite handy when we want to grab some milk, egg, cigarettes or etc. in the same street also has shop that bake fresh round bread which super delicious!!! When we arrived, we received warm welcome with fresh mint tea and biscuits by 'Saba' housekeeper. She will inform you and took you to show around the place. It liked home. It got everything ready to use. We liked the pool and open terrace which we did subbed during the day and barbecue and 3rd bedroom also on this floor.  

In bedrooms, they have build in shower and toilet with a few set of clean towel. 

This place is in the part of old town and not far from King's palace! It is set in a really good location. 

You must stay and you will love this place... 

10/10

Thank you Morocco to having us!!

493845,2991926,2017-01-06T11:20:09Z,"Wir waren eine Woche mit unserer 8 Monate alten Tochter im Riad und sind total begeistert! Angefangen von der perfekten Organisation (Abholung am Flughafen & Empfang im Riad), über die perfekte Lage in der Medina bis hin zur wunderschönen Unterkunft war dies eindeutig unsere bisher beste Airbnb-Erfahrung bisher!"
493845,95909417,2016-12-29T11:21:38Z,à recommander sans réserveparfaitement situé et très agréable   nous y reviendrons :-)
493845,61259416,2016-12-27T09:26:18Z,"What a wonderful experience. A chance to live in a real Moroccan riad in a secure part of old Marrakesh with a central courtyard and a roof garden. 
A driver to collect us from the airport and a housekeeper who had a preordered meal ready for us when we arrived - what could be better?"
493845,33051955,2016-12-21T10:02:24Z,Everything worked well. Highly recommend the place. 
493845,42507312,2016-12-13T01:56:55Z,"We spent 5 nights at Dar Ahwach and they were fantastics! Françoise was incredibly helpful during the booking process and provided us all the information we needed. Sabah helped us a lot and gave us all information about the city and also showed us the wonderful riad. Sabah is an angel! The location ended up being completely perfect. It was near to everything we wanted to see. The house itself was beautifully furnished, big, very clean, and so comfortable. We would like to thank again Françoise and Sabah for everything they did for us, we will never forget them. And we really recommend her wonderful house!"
493845,18803529,2016-11-26T05:58:06Z,Just back from a great trip to Marrakach and a lovely (EMAIL HIDDEN)fortable and convenient. Lovely stay overall. Wish the internet had more broadcast range. 
493845,702839,2016-11-16T05:07:28Z,The riad is located in a safe area within easy walking distance to the main square and souks (although it took until our last day to navigate our way straight there without getting lost through the side streets!) Sabbah is very welcoming and prepares everything you will need. It's was very clean and well equipped. I would recommend this riad to anyone going to stay in Marrakech. 
744971,53729871,2017-04-29T01:49:41Z,"This place is AMAZING! Even better than on the photos. It's surrounded by rice fields, so relaxing! The little cottage is super cute, and is immersed in nature: greens are climbing the bathroom walls, you fall asleep hearing the sound of the river and the sun rises behind your bed in the morning. Feels like you're way out of Ubud but it's at a walkable distance. You can also walk to the main facility where you will find a small pool, the coolest swing on the planet, and drinkable water. Staff was very helpful at check in and check out to help drivers find the place. Also if you're going with kids (reasonable age as they have to be careful when climbing/unclimbing) they're gonna love the upstairs bed. I 100% recommend the place! "
744971,117286498,2017-04-27T02:05:33Z,"Great experience when looking for something more than the usual hotel/guesthouse. So peaceful, can hear nature at night instead of busy Ubud. Would definitely stay again and highly recommended others to stay here!"
744971,4490145,2017-04-25T08:25:52Z,"The cottage is so picturesque, please take time to enjoy it fully as it is magical. I would say this is the perfect place for two, stretch it to three if you get on well and expect less comfort up top. However up top you get the view :) Safety is no issue at all as it is a peaceful place. Besides a female dog came around and quickly became our friend; she saw us out when we left, so cute. After I had enough from the hustle and bustle of the new style Ubud (spiritual in the Western sense nowadays: picture mass yoga classes and hype style cafes) this place was sheer reprieve and Bali at her very best. "
744971,50082264,2017-04-24T08:31:05Z,"超级棒!无敌浪漫,特别适合情侣,早上醒来被美哭!下次有机会再来一定多住几天!"
744971,3547172,2017-04-19T02:03:36Z,"Amazing place, surronded by nature. Not suitable for people not loving nature and animals (normal to find small frogs and ants in the bathroom; lizards in the cottage and small snakes in the fields). A bit far from the center of Ubud, but we definitely loved our stay!"
744971,4675353,2017-04-15T00:53:02Z,"I came across to the listing and book it immediately. I didn't know that there's also a pool when I made a reservation. So it was a really nice surprise for us. 

We love the experience, the place, the surroundings, and everything. We have done some glamping (glamorous camping) before, and Wayan's place took our glamping experience to the next level.

Highly recommended to give your children exciting experience to stay in the middle of a rice field in Ubud."
744971,41164304,2017-04-14T01:30:22Z,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour authentique au sein de ce logement perdu dans les rizières. Pour gagner la route principale, il vous faudra compter 5 min à pieds le long d'un sentier. 
C'est une expérience à vivre pour les personnes aimant la nature.
La pièce commune est très agréable.
Les petits déjeuners sont bien et peuvent être servis sur la terasse de votre chambre avec une vue superbe. 
Le personnel est tres tres bien, ils sont aidants et arrangeants.

Attention pour ceux qui ont peur des insectes car il s'agit d'un logement ouvert donc vous pouvez avoir avec vous des lézards, geckos et grenouilles (nous avions par exemple deux grenouilles dans la salle de bain). Une moustiquaire est présente et donc pratique pour la nuit. Il faut savoir qu'il y a le bruit des insectes la nuit."
744971,92967101,2017-04-12T03:58:13Z,It was a pleasure to stay there!!!
744971,49844879,2017-04-09T02:11:00Z,Overall a good accommodation. The description on line is one year outdated. There is no goat any longer. Still beautiful surrounding and nice quite location. Recommended 
744971,29663170,2017-04-07T03:02:11Z,"A 5 minute walk through the rice fields to the property. An unforgettable experience hard to describe and must be experienced to appreciate.  

Good food, helpful friendly staff, interesting world travellers to meet and socialize with. 

Romantic ""back to nature"" experience in an amazingly beautiful setting.

This place really made our trip to Bali a memorable experience.  "
744971,49265529,2017-04-04T01:56:59Z,A must stay if you're in Ubud. You're situated in an upscale cottage in the middle of rice fields. Don't hesitate if you are planning to stay here.  
744971,26022082,2017-03-31T01:17:13Z,"Amazing! Hands down such an great Airbnb. The cottage is exactly as pictured. They also brought us breakfast each morning and were the friendliest people. There's also a pool, swing and small bar/food that you can use. I'd highly recommend it. Just be aware that there are a lot of bugs. I'd recommend to friends & family 100%!"
744971,29992506,2017-03-29T00:40:06Z,"Easily the best Airbnb we ever stayed at. The location is absolutely perfect - about ten minutes away from the busy streets of Ubud, completely away from any noise in the middle of the rice fields. The cottage is located away from the other rooms. The path connecting Ubud to the area goes next to the cottage but it still gives a great sense of privacy.

At night the only sounds you hear are those of crickets, frogs and a waterfall. Looking up I saw more stars than I'd seen in my entire life.

During the day there's beautiful views accompanied by birds, butterflies, lizards and a friendly dog. There's good food and the cottage comes with free coffee (French press) and tea and there's a great smoothie. Everyone made us feel very welcome and is very helpful. The overall atmosphere in the area is very relaxed.

I wish I could give some kind of feedback to improve but I can't think of any. I highly recommend this place. "
744971,110537246,2017-03-23T00:47:14Z,Our flight was delayed by 6 hours and our midnight checkin was flawless. Be prepared for a bit of a hike to the cottage.  We mentioned that we were interested in sightseeing and the next morning we had a driver at our front entrance ready to take us all over the island. The view from our terrace was breathtaking and showering under the stars was a highlight.  
744971,96894496,2017-03-19T01:35:49Z,"Great value, peaceful setting."
744971,31014302,2017-03-14T03:10:35Z,"Really cool place to stay at, recommended! "
744971,42462052,2017-03-13T01:18:44Z,The eco cottage is Very Nice ..We spend a good Times  there 
744971,9328778,2017-03-10T02:19:15Z,"Both the birds nest and the bambu cottage are great places to stay. We slept one night in each of them. The birds nest is very cozy, a bit like a tent. It's a tower of four sleeping capsules in top of each other. It looks quite impressive. We liked it a lot. The bambu cottage gives you perfect privacy as it is approximately 100m away from the other facilities. The cottage has great architecture, and is also very cozy and nice. In both rooms you sleep more or less outside, only a roof gives you shelter, but because the whole accommodation is in a very hidden place, 5 min from the city but in the middle of some rice fields, it was a very nice experience. "
744971,27648825,2017-03-06T00:47:55Z,"Cest un endroit incroyablement beau! Etre dans cet eco cottage a vraiment était une expérience surprenante. Dormir en plein milieu des rizières est juste exceptionnel ! Merci Wayan, ton équipe est aux petits soin, à l'écoute et d'une gentillesse délicate.
Je reviendrais c'est sur !! "
744971,102957611,2017-03-05T01:38:44Z,Amazing cottage with awesome service. You'all sleep in between the rice fields and are in for a very special stay. We'll certainly go back in the future and recommend this location to everyone!
6080283,117251778,2017-05-12T16:48:41Z,"Die Lage ist wirklich super, von der Poolterrasse hat man Blick auf LA. Hinter dem Poolhaus ist sogar noch eine Sitzecke zum Entspannen.
Für zwei Personen ist das Haus vollkommen ausreichend und mit Liebe eingerichtet."
6080283,39602434,2017-05-04T18:47:58Z,"La Pool House de DnA est bien située et proche des axes routiers ce qui est très pratique. La vue est magnifique. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié la piscine ainsi que le patio privé.
La Pool House dispose de tout les éléments nécessaires pour passer un bon séjour."
6080283,107956983,2017-04-24T18:32:55Z,"Everything about this place was absolutely perfect! They provide you with everything in the house you would EVER need. Check-in was easy and all directions were clearly written including the gate code, spa temperature control, etc. It felt so relaxing and private and the view was to die for. I would and will highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for an amazing place to spend a vacation. Dan and Alex made sure we had everything we need and were more than accommodating. Thank you! "
6080283,112166579,2017-04-14T18:33:13Z,"It was beautiful, fwlt like home away from home. Loved that they provided so much for tennants. Shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, body wash, beach towels, a few snacks, and drinks. It was so nice not to have to pack all of that. If i didn't read the reviews I would have missed those details!! But loved it and will definitely stay there again. "
6080283,110372405,2017-04-09T17:48:06Z,"DnA's place is perfect!
Amazing views, and nice neighborhood. The place itself is amazing.. very clean, very well decorated, has everything you need and is actually a bit bigger than showed in pictures! 
I met both Dennis and Alex, and they are very friendly, helpful and made us feel right at home! 
I just loved staying here, hundred percent recommend it! 
"
6080283,2918647,2017-04-03T17:28:08Z,"We absolutely loved DnA's  poolhouse.  The view was stunning.  The house was so comfortable, every little detail taken into consideration.  The owners were extremely easy to communicate with and responded immediately when we contacted them.  We will stay here again when visiting LA.  "
6080283,57452158,2017-03-27T16:05:06Z,This spot is so dreamy. Perfect for our vacation getaway. Our hosts were great. Would highly recommend to everyone. 
6080283,29328378,2017-03-15T17:15:43Z,You will not be disappointed! Everything as expected. Close to freeways and the city sights. Amazing views of NELA. Highly recommend. DNA are very accommodating and available.
6080283,31900394,2017-03-07T17:31:40Z,"Dennis and Alex are incredibly warm, responsive, and helpful hosts.  This is the 3rd time I have stayed at their pool house and the views never grow old.  The setting is absolutely magnificent and tranquil.  The house is clean and well equipped.  The furnishings inside and out are really comfortable.  I look forward to returning many more times!  "
6080283,30932198,2017-03-02T17:49:02Z,"DnA's place has scenic views, it is very clean and well-equipped. The stay was wonderful. Highly recommended!!!! Excellent space, awesome hosts. "
6080283,42432526,2017-02-25T18:32:23Z,"This was our first trip to LA and we could have stayed in any number of places but the views and seclusion of a Pool House intrigued us to DnA's place. It exceeded our expectations. From the excellent communication with our Hosts to the views to the amenities to the beautiful house and cool neighborhood, everything was perfect. 

The pool house is secluded and is a spacious one bedroom with bathroom, living room, kitchen, bedroom, closet space, and a beautiful private patio. We could pack light because there was a full size washer and dryer to use (no checking bags!) and there's a few grocery stores nearby to quickly stock the kitchen with a few items. There's also ample secure parking.

This is the NELA area, close to Highland Park, Pasadena, and Eagle Rock, all places I didn't know much about but was very excited to be near for the coffee shops, bars, and record stores within a quick drive. Downtown and Los Feliz were a short drive away and getting further into LA took about as much time as we expected. 

If we come back, this is going to be our first option to stay again over any other place. The hosts treated us to wine and chocolate on arrival, detailed instructions on the house, and a list of plenty of things to do during the stay. The price was on par with a hotel but the service went above and beyond, we were truly made to feel like friends of the family during our stay. 

For all the years I wanted to visit LA, I couldn't have dreamed up a better place to stay for a first visit, this is what Airbnb is all about."
6080283,62908727,2017-02-17T17:46:22Z,"Had a lovely time at d&a pool house! We went to Vegas so spent 3 days out of the 5 there. But we would stay here again! The views are beautiful, I love the location! We felt very safe it was too cold to go in the pool. We do wish we got to enjoy the place to its fullest but we had so much to do so little time. 

I would recommend giving it a try! The house is a little gem the view made it very special. 

Didn't meet the hosts but communication was brilliant. Thank you for the wine and chocolates... Much appreciated! "
6080283,6751604,2017-02-11T17:09:04Z,Can't beat the views from this beautiful property! We had everything we needed in our little private pool house. We enjoyed discovering the nearby lively neighbourhoods of Northeast LA. Good location to leave the city as well for day trips. We did not get to meet the owners but communication was very good throughout. Thanks DNA hope to stay with you again some day.
6080283,5235649,2017-01-31T16:38:21Z,"DNA were fabulous hosts! Very friendly and helpful ...making sure we were comfortable From the minute we arrived we fell in love with the view ...beyond our expectations better then in the photos! We were greeted with wine and chocolate and helped us with out luggage which was a lovely gesture ! It' was so private and we felt like we were in a hotel , we didn't hear a peep from anyone it was so nice very respectful ! The room was so clean and we will definitely stay here again no problem !! This is a must if you want privacy this is yr place you won't even know anyone else is there!  If I could give these guys 20 star review I would!!! Thanks to you both we loved our stay !!! We were so blessed Highly recommended ...Till next time : Lil and Frank from Australia :)))"
6080283,14916799,2017-01-24T04:19:56Z,"It's not very often that an airbnb is even better than the photographs, but this place is! The pool house was beautifully kept, private, had amazing views, is very quiet and relaxing, and Dennis and Alex couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. Things were very clean and my husband and I enjoyed using the spa as well. Overall a great place and we would definitely stay here again! "
6080283,72940765,2017-01-14T17:48:15Z,"My wife and I stayed here over the course of a week for our honeymoon. We chose the pool house for not only the price but for everything you got for it. When we arrived, the first thing we fell in love with was the view. It is beyond anything we could've imagined. The inside of the pool house was very clean and organized, as well as having good amenities. There was chocolate and a bottle of wine waiting for us on the bed- which my wife loved. Throughout the entire stay Dennis and Alex were very easy to communicate with and extremely helpful. There was more rain than usual during our stay and despite there being some hiccups, they made sure we were greatly taken care of and even brought us more wine, chocolates and cupcakes to make up for any inconveniences. The house is about a 20-25 minute drive to downtown LA and 40-50 minutes from Santa Monica depending on the traffic. Though the pool house and main house are only as far away as the length of the pool, it felt very private, and the private patio area in back was great for dinner. Overall, we were very pleased with their house and we would highly recommend!! "
6080283,1173983,2016-12-31T17:08:42Z,"This is our second stay with DnA.  The hosts greeted us warmly on our return, and were easily available for concerns or questions while giving us the privacy we wanted to come and go as we pleased.  This is a wonderful little unit that is separate from the main home.  It is very convenient to Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, Los Feliz, the 134/101 corridor and downtown LA.  We will definitely be back on future visits."
6080283,91124983,2016-12-21T06:23:46Z,"Everything was as promised. Good location, Dan and Alex were great hosts and the poolhouse has everything you need :)"
6080283,84888287,2016-12-04T05:06:28Z,"My wife and I had an absolutely fantastic time staying at DnA's Pool house! From the moment we reserved this place on airbnb to our check out time, DnA's communication with us was excellent.
If we had any questions they were always on hand to answer them and were very helpful in suggesting places we should visit/dine at.
The pool house itself was everything we needed. A clean and modern bathroom, a well equipped kitchen, a lounge with a tv (even a few movies!), a very comfortable bedroom. We never entered the pool due to the time of year we visited, but it was always clean and did look very inviting!
I can easily recommend staying at this pool house for anyone considering DnA as their hosts. They were fantastic!"
6080283,25960855,2016-11-24T01:56:01Z,The pool house is perfect and despite being part of a shared accommodation with the main house it's soooo private! Location is on par for anyone who had a car. It's literally no more than 30/40 mins from all of the main attractions. The host Alex and Dennis were fab. Left us to our own devices but always on hand if needed. When they didn't hear from us they always checked in via AnB app to make sure we were ok. Honestly could not have asked for more.
444289,72279462,2017-04-26T11:31:10Z,"The house is great and beautiful. The location is isolated yet is near enough to the Akureyri town. Very convenient.  There is no food in the fridge which is totally fine because you can be sure the fridge is free from odour or rotting leftovers. A great experience staying in the house. Thank you, Gunnar."
444289,105720052,2017-04-22T09:47:03Z,"Had a great time in a great house.
Very close and convenient to Akureryi"
444289,34504749,2017-04-19T15:03:51Z,"Gunnar was a gracious host. His home is one of the most epic spots I've stayed before. The bay windows overlooking the Northern Iceland landscape will satisfy any photographer or view chaser. The hot tub is a great way to unwind, the bathroom is well appointed and the beds are very comfortable. Gunnar provided great commutation. We hope to stay here again in the future. "
444289,1481337,2017-04-17T08:23:26Z,Gunnar's house is fantastic.. freshwater hot tub and magnificent views!  Communication with Gunnar was easy and responsive.
444289,54395563,2017-04-12T11:57:38Z,"Great location for going around Northern Iceland, very modern and spacious house. Only cons are that the hot tub is difficult to operate and communication with the host was spotty but maneagable.

Overall would definitely recommend this place."
444289,76843000,2017-04-08T11:36:33Z,"Great stylish home with amazing views of Akureryi, positions you well to reach the city, whale watching and the main waterfall.

Gunnar was very helpful and responsive, thank you!!"
444289,114981898,2017-04-05T08:44:09Z,Gorgeous house and location overlooking the fjord.  So cozy and the view made it so you just wanted to sit in the living room and watch the clouds role by all day.
444289,7708754,2017-04-01T11:10:51Z,Beautiful modern home overlooking a gorgeous fjord. Beautiful view of the Capital of the North at night. Geothermal hot tub was nice at night. Great restaurants in town. Great central spot for travels in the north.
444289,73737445,2017-03-29T09:09:47Z,"We loved Gunnar's house! Akureyri and surroundings are amazing. There are a lots of things to do. It's a shame that we only stayed for 3 nights (if you can stay more). The house is so amazing and comfortable that at least for one day you have to stay there, cook yourself and enjoy it. 

Gunnar is a great host, even though we didn't met him in person he called us by phone and was eager to respond any doubts and he did some suggestions about things to do in Akureyri. 

We were so lucky that we were able to enjoy northern lights at the house during our stay. 

Gracias Gunnar! 
"
444289,90614888,2017-03-22T10:37:11Z,Everything was perfect. The house and the surrounding area around it had so much to offer.
444289,9317707,2017-03-13T08:51:00Z,Beautiful home overlooking the city. The house is great place to just admire the beauty that is Iceland. The living room is the best part of the house be abuse of the big windows. Had a great stay here.
444289,31514028,2017-03-04T10:30:58Z,"房源景觀很不錯,但房東對待房客的態度很差勁,再無確認情況下多次隨意誣賴房客,我們長期在世界各地使用Airbnb住宿,第一次遇到這種情況,覺得必須講出來讓大家做為其他房客的入住考量。第一,我們使用屋主所配的吹風機,造成廁所及兩個房間跳電,被誣賴我們使用錯誤電壓的吹風機,我相信有很多人會帶自己的吹風機,且不懂電壓錯誤的危險,但房東未經確認,就先責備我們。第二,使用房東的熱水池,被誣賴我們不當運作24小時,後來房東居然禁止我們使用這熱水池及吹風機。第三,房東本身未居住於房源所在地,皆是透過保全管理,一直跟我抱怨每次找保全過去要100歐,要我支付這些費用。第四,房東判斷每件事情都是站在懷疑房客的立場,本身又不是很負責任,例如入住時,未主動告知密碼,如何順利進入屋內,而是我們先詢問有沒有什麼需要注意的事項才告知,烘衣機及洗碗機內皆有物品未妥善歸位,基於上述總總,還是要跟各位講,房子的景觀真的很漂亮,但如果你入住時,這個不能用,那個不能用,那你還住這個房子幹嘛!"
444289,14608230,2017-02-24T08:58:42Z,"Absolutely fantastic, clean, beautiful, comfortable, I could sit in the chair under the wool blanket all day if I wasn't exploring the beautiful area. Highly recommended."
444289,1304669,2017-02-18T10:21:15Z,"It was my second visit. Had a great time. Thank you, Gunnar."
444289,110449662,2017-01-29T08:40:31Z,Big house. I love this place. scenery is super cool
444289,60554069,2017-01-15T10:03:33Z,"Gunnar was very friendly and helpful when we contacted him.

House is in an amazing private location about 7 min drive out of Akureyri.

The views across the fjord to Akureyri were breathtaking.

All the beds were very comfortable.

Unfortunately the hot tub was not operational during our stay due to the cold weather (-7 deg Celcius).

We were however very close to many winter time activities. 

I'd strongly recommend the Myvatn Nature Baths which was a little over 1 hours drive for anyone visiting the area for the first time.

Thanks again."
444289,51560618,2016-12-27T08:04:20Z,Gunnar was helpful and the location was great. The house was stunning and I would recommend this!
444289,2184440,2016-11-14T18:59:50Z,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
444289,46055329,2016-11-12T02:21:46Z,Outstanding views.  Location could not be better for exploring northern Iceland.  Great house - exactly as described and Gunnar was a pleasure to work with.  Would definitely stay again.
444289,100223855,2016-11-02T10:08:11Z,"Super locatie, "
283638,18028091,2017-05-12T08:44:07Z,"The home is beautiful and the view is unbelievable.  The location couldnt be more perfect, however just know that one of the bedrooms does not have a door. That bedroom is not private and so not ideal for couples. 

It's ok for one couples + their kids as the main bedroom has a door. 

Regardless, we still enjoyed our stay. Laskarina sent us some really nice recommendations and offered us a complimentary bottle of wine. "
283638,76304255,2017-04-30T11:56:49Z,Laskarina was awesome with communication. She had the porter meet us at the bus stop where our van dropped us off (this is super close to the house). I spent hours looking at air bnbs and I'm so happy I chose this one! It is in the BEST location - next to Skala's restaurant and Ambrosia. All of the best restaurants are a few steps away! The home is in the most central part of Oia. I've been there before and you don't want to be too many steps away from the main road. The views were amazing and the house is beautifully decorated with plenty of living and dining space with 2 separate bedrooms and 1 bathroom. The cave house is stunning and clean. She left a bottle of wine and a local cell phone as well. The views were amazing and we had a private patio for 2 + a larger patio with built in bench seating. Wine drinking on the patio will never be the same. She also receommended restaurants and places to go and all of them were great. We really enjoyed Candouni and Vinyart for wine after. Don't look any further...book this place! You won't be disappointed.
283638,1350757,2017-04-22T11:37:15Z,"We loved our stay at Laskarina's place- great location, close to everything without too many stairs! Laskarina was a fantastic host, highly recommend. "
283638,108919091,2017-02-22T07:50:19Z,"Laskarina was a great host. She arranged transportation on both ends of our stay, and a porter to help move our luggage to our wonderful quintessential cave like home in the cliff. There was a bowl of fresh fruit on the table and a bottle of wine awaiting us in the fridge. The pictures are all spot on with detail. Bakeries, restaurants, shops are all within very short walking distance. The view is most amazing. Laskarina was a fabulous host, we did not meet her but she responded quickly to questions by email. I would not hesitate to say I will return to stay at her home again! "
283638,12463096,2017-02-02T06:07:52Z,"The photos look accurate and the host provided great amenities - there were fruits on the table when we arrived, Apivita shower gels and shampoos, a great hair dryer, reliable Wifi and plenty of towels. 

The house itself is fantastic, with an open view of the sea. It was quite chilly during our time in Oia but the house stayed warm and cozy even when we left the heating off. It was also conveniently located, just a minute from a main road in Oia and plenty of restaurants and supermarkets nearby.

The host arranged transportation to and from the airport and the driver was really friendly and even recommended things we could do! 

One thing to take note of, if you're going this time of the year, is the renovation noises, which started sharp at 8am every morning. Not a problem with the place itself, it's just that there are usually lots of renovation going on this time of the year in Santorini. "
283638,4945535,2017-01-02T09:41:28Z,"Laskarina's place is absolutely magical. We came just after Christmas for the New Year. Since it was off-season the town was empty and practically everything was closed, but it was perfect - quiet, peaceful and relaxing. The home itself is beautiful and comfortable, with everything you need. The beds are extremely cozy and you have all the basics in the kitchen. Towels, shampoo, everything is there. Laskarina was really easy going and flexible with our arrival/departure times. She even arranged to have transport for us to/from the airport which I would highly recommend. It is just a few steps down from the main road, so you don't have to walk down a ton of stairs, but still quiet and a beautiful view. Loved it!"
283638,104748550,2016-12-29T09:19:30Z,Thanks!
283638,102100268,2016-11-26T06:24:04Z,Awesome!
283638,59818353,2016-11-24T06:42:00Z,"We traveled to Oia during Late November and couldn't have been more pleased with Laskarina's home! Our expectations were exceeded both inside the home and especially with the large patio over looking the most beautiful sunrises and views. There were still several restaurants, markets, cafes, bakeries and shops open. We walked to see the sunsets each night and felt fortunate it was off season. Good walking shoes and agility on foot are  a must, especially if you hike down to the Sea. Laskarina arranged our airport transfer both ways and a porter. Anna was available for maid service if needed. I hope to return and highly recommend this home. We traveled with our 2  college age children, 2 couples would work well also."
283638,22624103,2016-10-25T07:00:08Z,"Hands down the most beautiful place with the most beautiful views I have ever stayed in. Clean, spacious, unique modern style with THE BEST VIEW of the island! Love, love, love!"
283638,1510161,2016-10-21T07:26:49Z,"Fantastic Stay!  Beautiful cave house - pics just can't capture it all!  Laskarina was a wonderful host; she arranged transportation from and to the airport with assistance with luggage to house.  Everything about this location was perfect - a few steps to town Oia!  The cave house was so tastefully designed with everything we needed, including wine, water, fruit and coffee!  The terrace was beyond gorgeous and the restaurants next door did not have any noise impact on our stay - and their food is good.  Such a peaceful beautiful home and environment that we hated to leave.  Definitely recommend!  Thank you Laskarina for a wonderful holiday in your cave house!"
283638,60486758,2016-10-13T07:16:39Z,Laskarina has a cute cave house. The house is nice and clean. The view is great! What we loved the most about her place is the location. It's literally steps away from the main street of Oia. Another best part is there were two nice restaurants next to her house. We didn't have a chance to meet Laskarina but we met her husband John. She also provided us with a cellphone with a local number that we could use during our stay to reach out to her.
283638,19856726,2016-09-27T00:26:31Z,"К сожалению, хозяйку аппартаментов, мы не встретили, но на момент нашего прибытия в квартире был ее муж Янис, который нам все показал и пояснил, а так же предоставил телефон с греческой СИМ картой, по которому мы могли с ним связаться.
Сама квартира очень элегантная и удобная , с захватывающим  видом на Кальдеру. Хотя и нет прямого вида на знаменитый закат, но несколько мест с которых он хорошо виден , недалео от апартаментов. Рядом проходит дорожка по которой утром и вечером спускаются и поднимаются ослики , рядом два хороших ресторана - Скала и Фрога. Оба рекомендую, первый по- проще, второй по- изысканней.
Мне очень понравилось  спать в спальне - пещере, очень необычно.

Спасибо Ласкарине за приятный сюрприз - бутылку прекрасного Санторинского вина и  яблоки! 

И особая благодарность за возможность позднего выезда и обеспечение трансферов.  Могу с уверенностью рекомендовать эти аппартаменты!"
283638,6627715,2016-09-22T07:51:26Z,"Check in was a bit difficult but we managed. The location overlooks the caldera and has fantastic views. Right off the main footpath so touristy traffic is inevitable and a bit prying.  However, all of the restaurants and shops are just a step away which is invaluable. Free parking in a lot within an 8 minute walk. Unit was clean and comfortable, bottle of wine provided which was a nice touch. Overall good experience. "
283638,16936513,2016-09-10T01:35:28Z,"This is one of the most unique, memorable, and beautiful places we have ever stayed and we travel A LOT. ""Unique Architecture"" and Laskarina and John's adjoining properties must be some of the most stunning on all of AirBnb! We can't say enough about how cozy the place is. The views from the terrace (which is massive) are stunning. Great place to have your breakfast or enjoy a bottle of local wine that Laskarina and John provide as a welcome upon checkin. They are full of good ideas and recommendations for restaurants/activities/hidden gems. Don't even bother scouring the web for restaurant reviews, etc, just take their word for it, they won't steer you wrong! As others have said in reviews, you are RIGHT in the middle of a very popular area. Steps to everything. But at the same time, ""Unique Architecture"" feels very private, relaxing, and exclusive. There were only two of us traveling, but this place would be perfect for four. It's huge. Really can't say enough about ""Unique Architecture."" There is lots to see and do in Santorini but you almost don't want to leave the apartment. If you are looking for a second-to-none experience in Oia that you will never forget, your search ends here. Thank you John and Laskarina, we hope to be back someday. "
283638,29919005,2016-09-03T04:25:04Z,"We spent 4 days in Santorini and wanted a special place where to celebrate a milestone birthday. This place was just perfect, I couldn't recommend it more. The view is just unbelievable and a pleasure to wake up up to every morning. It is extremely well located although it is a little overlooked by tourists walking on the main streets which is difficult to avoid where you're after a room with caldera view. Upon arrival, Laskarina sent us a little guide with restaurants and places to visit that we found extremely helpful."
283638,82308940,2016-08-29T06:48:27Z,"The location of the place is wonderful, and the view is spectacular. Lots of stuff around the apartment to eat/shop. The place is very nice, and I would definitely stay there again!"
283638,14432845,2016-08-26T00:08:27Z,"The villa was beyond our expectations!  Our arrival was perfectly coordinated with a driver and porter (needed help with suitcases), and we were greeted with a large bowl of fruit, and a chilled bottle of wine.  Laskarina's design talent is subtle yet apparent throughout the rooms. Thank you, your husband and your wonderful staff for making our staff so successful."
283638,57531426,2016-08-06T01:57:11Z,"What a breathtaking view to wake up to every morning! A shady spot for breakfast as the sunrises and the crowds start to appear. The house is in a perfect spot and thankfully not on the 'sunset' side, which would have been a nightmare every evening. You are very slightly over looked by tourists but that is inevitable in Oia and it doesn't spoil the stay. I wanted peace and quiet from my stay and  although  it is not completely quiet it is the most magical place to stay and incredibly restful. The restaurant, Skala, is great, just above the house and worth at least one visit.  The noise of the donkeys tripping up and down to the very small and stoney beach below punctuates the day and never fails to make you smile. The kitchen is small but more than adequate,  there are plenty of towels, a very lovely small bathroom carved into the  rock and two beautiful double rooms with comfortable beds. It will be on my list of of places to return to.... Thank you Laskarina...."
283638,61562514,2016-07-29T03:05:05Z,"A home nestled in the Caldera on the island of Santorini - what mare needs to be said?   It was a great place!!!   Nice little kitchen set up for wine and coffee use, great patios with VIEWS that went on and on!   Wifi allowed us to let friends and family share our trip with us via social media.    I highly recommend this home to anyone.   Could sleep 6 if needed."
860170,48591221,2017-05-13T07:53:57Z,Calim's apartment is beautiful! It's right in the middle of everything in the old town and had a constant hum of bagpipes! Calim was a great host and we will definitely be back!
860170,19453370,2017-05-07T10:57:33Z,"Sehr schöne, indviduelle Wohnung, super gelegen. Man kann sowohl Old Town als auch New Town wunderbar zu Fuß entdecken.

Calim hat prima Tipps für Restaurants und ist in der Kommunikation sehr schnell und immer gut zu erreichen. 

Wir haben es sehr genossen!"
860170,87849670,2017-05-02T10:25:33Z,"If you're looking for a place to stay in Edinburgh, this is the place to stay. It's centrally located and a stunning place to stay. Calim was an amazing host - our best AirBnB experience so far. He communicated with me throughout the process, sent us a large list of restaurant recommendations and even asked if we wanted him to pick us up some tickets to a local festival while we were in town. When we arrived we found a loaf of fresh bread, eggs, orange juice and fresh jams. We ended up using this for breakfast for most of our stay which allowed us to sleep in and not have to find food. 

The hotel is located RIGHT on the royal mile so be aware that there is a lot of street noise. Wasn't an issue for us because we had ear plugs. 

We love this place and were sad to leave. Thanks for your hospitality, Calim!"
860170,106797750,2017-04-25T07:31:21Z,Good
860170,105429989,2017-04-23T09:25:19Z,A beautiful place to stay with an impeccable host
860170,24029122,2017-04-21T09:19:05Z,Cannot fault a thing!
860170,61191641,2017-04-20T10:24:19Z,"To say that Calim's apartment is stunning would be an understatement. I realised when I got home that I had taken more pictures of the apartment than of Edinburgh itself during our four day visit. 

The apartment is centrally located on Royal Mile, within close distance of the castle and around 10 minutes walk to the New Town. It is beautifully presented and included everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. There is a four flight climb up a spiral staircase to reach the apartment. This didn't bother us but is worth keeping in mind for anyone with any access issues. 

There is so much to do in the area and too many great places to eat for just a short visit. We treated ourselves to the tasting menu at Tom Kitchin's restaurant (The Kitchin) in Leith. This was a fantastic experience and well worth the short bus ride to Leith. We also ate at El Cartel, a Mexican on Thistle Street, New Town. We loved it here so much we went twice. El Cartel's sister bar/restaurants Bon Vivant (over the road from El Cartel) and Devil's Advocate (Old Town, just a few mins from the apartment) are well worth a visit. Calim also suggested a number of other places which we didn't get around to visiting but are worth checking out. 

We fell in love with Calim's apartment as much as we did with Edinburgh and hope to return soon."
860170,26096494,2017-04-17T07:49:59Z,"I can’t recommend Calim’s beautiful flat more. The location is perfect for exploring Edinburgh, and the flat itself is just wonderful. Calim’s list of recommendations and all the personal touches in the flat are brilliant. We will certainly be returning again!"
860170,1514874,2017-04-14T08:27:56Z,"There's a reason this place is booked all the time. 

Looks exactly like the photos and description is spot on.

860170,18177138,2017-04-13T07:43:52Z,"We felt like royalty on the royal mile! You feel like you're in the middle of everything in Edinburgh, and at the same time, you have the privacy you need being on the 4th floor. We were greeted by great music playing on the CD player as well as some nice goodies Calim left for us to nibble on throughout our stay. Above and beyond! Thank you for a grand stay and your hospitality at your incredible apartment! All of Calim's instructions were straight forward and we felt at home. "
860170,58171921,2017-04-10T07:11:54Z,"A quirky apartment in a location that can't be beaten! We were within easy walking distance of all the things we wanted to do and see!
Calim was lovely and so helpful before our trip, making us feel at ease. 
After climbing the spiral staircase to enter the apartment, we were blown away by how lovely it was. It was immaculately clean and there were so many personal touches that made it feel like home (including bread, milk and orange juice!) We loved browsing through the fabulous book selection and looking at all the little trinkets dotted around.
We would definitely love to stay again when we next come to Edinburgh! "
860170,58296116,2017-04-08T08:33:14Z,"Perfect stay in a beautiful apartment with an amazing location. Calim was a great host, very helpful and with great attention to detail. Wish we could have stayed longer! Thanks again Calim."

His attention to detail and consideration for guests' stay was truly above and beyond.

His recommendations for food and drink were great, and definitely enhanced our stay. timberyard was a wonderful, and very memorable dinner.

860170,34453720,2017-03-27T08:37:38Z,"This place is amazing.  AMAZING.  Calim is also the most magical person...  Everything he recommended landed us into the best spots in Edinburgh with the best people I have met in any city.  The place is as pictured and as reviewed.  I usually don't trust ratings because I know that you can't please everyone, and some people just love to complain... but it seems like Calim has managed the impossible... EVERYONE loves his place and his person.  Just go.  Go.  You will love it."
860170,50916388,2017-03-24T09:15:18Z,"I recommend this place to anyone who wants to explore Edinburgh. The location is great, and Calim was a fabulous host! My friend and I were very happy with our stay!! "
860170,18714476,2017-03-23T09:46:53Z,Beautiful and artistic flat. Best airbnb that we have stayed at. Shows the difference between someone's home and bought-to-rent. 
860170,7334834,2017-03-19T10:28:18Z,"This is the place to stay in Edinburgh! Everything was better than advertised and exceeded our expectations. Calim's flat is so comfortable and made us feel like we were at home. The location was spectacular and close to everything we wanted to do. Calim was so responsive to our communications, gave us fabulous recommendations for food and drink, and made sure every detail was in place to make our stay absolutely fantastic. We cannot recommend this flat enough! Thank you Calim!"
860170,111906436,2017-03-13T11:57:15Z,"Had a great time staying here. The apartment is lovely and in such a good location. Little touches just made it that extra special. Music playing on our arrival, fresh bread, eggs etc for our use. Calim was very helpful in suggesting places to eat and things to see and do which made our trip all the more enjoyable."
860170,2914383,2017-03-11T10:54:30Z,Fabulous flat but even more fabulous owner.  My husband and I were in Edinburgh for a short period of time. We are so glad that we stayed at Calim's flat. The location is perfect. Edinburgh Castle is a 5 min walk. Calim took such good care of us. Communication was excellent. We cannot thank Calim enough. We highly recommend this place.
2168594,127342839,2017-05-11T07:37:27Z,"很安静,可以自己做饭,但是会有虫子,不知道是不是我不会用,洗澡没有热水 ,如果有租摩托去各个地方还是很方便,因为是三户挨着,所以如果其他国家朋友有时差可能你睡觉时会有点吵,管家Manot不错,帮你租摩托不需要压护照和现金,有什么问题可以向他咨询。"
2168594,53784004,2017-05-06T09:42:13Z,"AMAZING place!!!
But you definitely better to rent a scooter! Easy access to the city, big mall, beach and nice local restaurant ;) the place is little hilly, quiet and dark in the night, so if you don't rent a car or scooter, then it's gonna be a little inconvenient.

Pool was always clean, great kitchen and nice and huge bed (even enough for 3ppl if you're girls) 

The owner is super nice friendly guy and his kitty was adorable xx

I'll come back with my family next time ;))

Definitely good value!!


Thank you Manut and Zokson to make our trip amazing!"
2168594,51037794,2017-05-01T03:42:19Z,"Great stay at white villa! The house managers are very helpful and kind, especially you have any specific questions. Though it is a little far away from the hub city, you can still reach any places within 50 minutes rides. Hope to stay here once again!"
2168594,22064070,2017-04-11T03:47:38Z,It's a very nice place clean and quite. You can enjoy your time with your family in the villa or go to the nearby beach within 10 minutes riding motor bike.

2168594,102331362,2017-01-28T03:03:06Z,"非常舒服的别墅,真正的度假而不是旅游,管家很热情,服务很周到,摩托车可以在管家这里借,非常安静,舒服的风景,打开窗听到虫鸣鸟叫。
每天最享受白天开车摩托车从别墅去市区,沿着环海山路奔驰20分钟,是真正的度假。
推荐情侣,懂得生活的人入住"
2168594,89265154,2017-01-21T04:16:48Z,"入住4晚,入住时候告知这期间没有清洁,垃圾袋没帮忙换也没主动提供,后来我们自己向管家要的!这个差强人意。地方偏僻了,但绝对的安静和干净,床铺很舒服."
2168594,41925556,2017-01-17T03:23:19Z,"初到villa,chaiya热情的接待的我们,耐心地向我们交代wifi密码啦等等,并且告诉我们后院的水果,香料如有需要可以自己采摘烹饪,那颗木瓜树真的很棒,果子超甜。院里有只小白猫,超乖,叫阿喵,是管家养的,铲屎官的我又拔不动腿了。管家还帮忙租了摩托车,住在这里的八天出行都靠小摩托,非常方便!拉威海鲜市场非常近,记得砍价!附近的711,family mart都可以满足买水,零食的需要。再远一点的莲花超市很大,生鲜,蔬菜很丰富,适合自己烹饪。4021附近有个当地居民采购的农贸市场,便宜到没朋友,具体位置在比查龙码头稍远一些的路边,骑车就可以看到。spa推荐kim,我是在普吉镇做的,慕名而去,性价比很高,后来发现家门口就有,在我去拉威海鲜市场的路上,连锁的,可以(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)支付,方便极了!总而言之,住在这里很棒,舍不得离开。"

I higely recommend this place"
2168594,87259604,2016-09-10T02:19:37Z,"When we go is the rainy season, so often encountered rain, to travel has brought a lot of inconvenience. But the house is very clean and tidy, the swimming pool is very clean, the environment is very good, the air is fresh. Is a little too partial, go to eat have to go very far, car rental places are also very far away, travel is not convenient, the other is good"
2168594,39450541,2016-08-16T01:34:13Z,"The white breeze villa apartments is super, it has been designed and decorated in great taste and the minimalist decor provides a calming retreat in the more upmarket part of Phuket. Would certainly recommend it."
2168594,28694850,2016-07-31T03:51:26Z,"Very nice villa. It has all you need inside.
The neighbour was very calm and safe. Mr.Zokson helped us with the taxi (to pick us up from the airport and vice versa) he also provided us with scooter so we could move around because the villa is a little bit far (15mins walk) from the restaurants and bars. There is no beach around the rawai area but with 10-15mins in scooter you can visit different beaches such as Nai Han (very nice).
Mr. Manol (the administrator) was very kind and beside taking care of the villa (the pool and the garden) he also suggested us places to visit nearby.
Overall very clean and calm villa.
P.s. keep in mind that the pool is a share pool with the other 2 appartments that has the villa (as in photo)."
2168594,26289111,2016-07-14T02:51:42Z,"Great hideaway and the place is looking as great as in the pics. The taxi driver sent by Zokson was an extremely polite and kind gentleman, which meant a great start and end to our trip. The communication was Zokson was sufficient, no issues."
2168594,26531240,2016-07-02T03:16:59Z,"Beautifully modern condo with a great pool, shower, A/C and cooking area. Pick up and drop off with the driver was at a great rate and very easy. The bike rental was also very easy and essential for this trip. I would definitely recommend if you want to have a relaxing vacation in Rawai."
2168594,72042640,2016-06-28T05:45:56Z,"私人泳池很方便,个人游泳还是泳池合适,海是冲浪的。在拉威上虽然有些远可是租个摩托车即可,个人感觉千万别住芭东无聊又商业,离拉威海鲜市场不远去吃海鲜方便。去了奈汉海滩挺近,芭东坐双条车去这个公寓公价700,可以讲价的。普吉岛坐车百元起标,清迈是十元起标。"

1838274,17415816,2017-05-08T07:05:45Z,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at Carla's place.  The town of Riva is beautiful, scenic and quaint, and it was the perfect place to land between our Milan and Venice tours.  Carla and Ivan were gracious and welcoming hosts.  Very restful and beautiful, and we'd highly recommend it to other travelers! "
1838274,113030537,2017-05-03T09:39:51Z,"Lovely view, the mountains and the lake! It was very relaxt. Very kind people. Carla and Ivan were very kind and helpfull. 
The pool was closed because of the weather. That was a shame, but the kids liked it anyway. 
We had a good stay. We visit some cities nearby; Bergamo, Loveres and others. All very nice. "
1838274,5705728,2017-04-25T07:32:34Z,"Carla's flat is located in a residential complex with a beautiful panorama on the lake and the mountains. Carla is a very friendly host and takes care about her guests paying attention to every detail. 
The apartment is sized for a family up to 4 people and the main bedroom has a beautiful window with a view. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need, there's also a modern TV set. 
Guests can get free access to the pool and the tennis court. The cosy town of Riva di Solto can be reached with a 5 minutes walk."
1838274,43441693,2017-04-17T06:36:56Z,"Apartment and location perfect for a family of 4. You can bicycle to Lovere on a lovely road around the lake. Only a few cars are taking it. A great - and quite unknown - place to visit if you like quietness and nature: logo di moro. A nice 1h walk around a small natural lake on top of a mountain. 
Carla and Ivan have been friendly and helped us via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) on any query we had either about the apartment or our rides.
Strongly recommend!"
1838274,21458446,2017-04-13T09:24:25Z,"We had a excellent time at Carla's place. The view was spectacular and the town allowed us to experience traditional genuine Italian hospitality. 

We would love to come back to Riva di Solto."
1838274,118082260,2017-04-04T09:34:51Z,"The view of Lago Iseo really is as spectacular as it looks in the photo.  Ivan was great to meet us and help us get oriented and situated.  Ivan and Carla’s modest 2nd home is clean and neat, with a South facing balcony looking over Lago Iseo which we enjoyed and used to dry clothes after using the washing machine.  It is one of about a dozen apartments sharing a pool and other amenities.  We were off on our plans and time of year to most fully appreciate it both because the boat on the lake wasn’t stopping at Riva Di Solto as expected, and it was too cool yet for the pool to be open.  But my son and I enjoyed games of tennis and bowling and seemed to have the entire place all to ourselves.  There were hardly any other guests.  Our top recommendation for a meal is the nearby Bellavista Restaurant only a short winding curve or two up the hill from the home.   This is a great place to get away from the busy life.  "
1838274,112301760,2017-03-25T10:29:49Z,"What a beautiful location and apartment! Very welcoming owners and interior! 
 Car Hire is a MUST to explore the area, quiant little restaurants dotted around the nearby lakes. All local information left in note form for guests which was really easy to understand and useful! 

Thankyou for a great trip Carla! "
1838274,92743452,2017-03-19T07:57:13Z,The hosts and location were amazing! They will go out of their ways to make sure your stay is comfortable and pleasant. The view is second to none and loved the home. Definitely a recommendation for others. 
1838274,59233203,2017-03-15T07:22:03Z,"Amazing views and nice flat . monte ISOLA - so cool island !! we rented bicycles and cycled all around. with eating in the middle and stopping a lot , it took only 2.5h. probably 1 hour if no stops . Loved the island . Restaurant Miranda was the best in our opinion. Didn't really like the pizza place near by. but it might be just our opinion. however , If u go there , dont get ""house wine "" , it's terrible ... anyways. all cool. There was really nice restaurant ART - in Lovere. Town short drive away. It was the best wine , best pizza and best pasta. We tried 4 restaurants. and few other places during days.  and Miranda and ART we liked the most . :) ( Miranda is in riva Di Solto ) . We had really nice holiday and owners of the flat where checking in on us every day , and that's nice. Tennis court was available too but we didn't use it. "

"
1838274,65616807,2017-02-21T07:15:52Z,"Would really recommend staying at Carla & Ivan's place! The view is just as it looks in the pictures - even in February! We can only imagine how beautiful it must be in the summer. Hopefully we'll find out one day!
Their place is clean, spacious and peaceful. It's also within walking distance of a couple of local shops and restaurants (and the lake). It's only about an hour's walk to Lovere too, which is a lovely town. The walk does take you along the road, but there's more joggers and cyclists than there are cars!
The locals in Riva di Solto were all very welcoming and friendly; everybody says hello.
There's also a nice walk from Riva di Solto, up an old mule track to a panoramic view and through some old villages with cobbled streets. It's referred to as a ""nature trail"" and also as a ""moderate hike"", but we'd describe it more as just a pleasant walk around the local area! There's some really nice views along the way.
Activities-wise, you're probably better off hiring a car when staying in Riva di Solto. There aren't many buses and the ferries don't go from there during the winter months, so it can be a little tricky getting around. We did manage by bus and on foot though! And Carla & Ivan are always there to ask for advice; they're both very helpful.
We'd definitely stay there again!"
1838274,26122736,2017-02-16T10:06:09Z,"We had an amazing time here at this beautiful flat in Riva Di Solto. The view from the balcony is breathtaking, the flat itself is very homely and Carla and Ivan were lovely and very helpful. There are many great restaurants and Riva Di Solto itself is very peaceful and beautiful. I would definitely recommend staying here and we'll definitely return at some point!"
1838274,19643740,2017-01-29T07:38:48Z,Carla's place is amazing. You'll find a very comfortable apartment with a stunning view fitted with everything you'll need for a relaxing break. Ivan greeted us upon arrival and only left until we were settled. He was very kind and welcoming and left us with a few nibbles for breakfast next day. We recommend and would definitely come back.
1838274,103118573,2017-01-21T08:08:24Z,"Riva di solto is a really good place for the vacation. Carla's flat is really beautiful and has really good views of lake and mountain. She prepared everything very well,like fruits,juice,milk,map and many towels. She explained the using of flats really compeletly and text us how's our vacation everyday. She's full of passion,and we are really looking forward to have chance to stay in her apartment agian"
1838274,24778810,2017-01-16T08:06:32Z,Great place. Carla is a fantastic host and very attentive. She checked in everyday to offer recommendations and to see if we needed anything. We had an issue with the heating (probably operator error) and Carla immediately sent a plumber. Apartment has an amazing view of the mountains and lake. Close by some quaint towns with great restaurants.

I had some trouble for arriving in Riva di solto .  I hope to back one day but then in the summer. 
There are some very good hikes along the lake if you like walking. It is very calm and beautiful. 

All the best.

1838274,9947219,2016-11-02T09:04:38Z,Stunning view!  Exactly like the pictures.   The apartment was clean & spacious.  Carla & Ivan were great hosts.  Easy communication.  Will stay here again! 
1838274,4397051,2016-10-25T06:03:19Z,"My girlfriend and I wanted a peaceful retreat for a week and it was absolutely perfect for us. The views from the apartment are sublime and I can't imagine better views from anywhere else. Everything you need is available and Carla and Ivan are brilliant hosts. They were super friendly and made us feel very welcome, we couldn't ask for more. Even though we went in late October it is a trip we will never forget, it is such a special place. We travelled around the lake and to another lake nearby but you can't beat the views from this apartment. It was undoubtedly the best view In the area! We absolutely loved our time there. Thank you very much Carla and Ivan for having us!"
70792,42853957,2017-04-25T08:11:50Z,Emma is a sweetheart and her place is amazing way beyond what I could have expected lush beautiful gardens and the room was more like an apartment. The house was a beautiful mansion we had access to it was like staying in the museum. And they were so sweet to have a beautiful breakfast out for us early because of our early flight. Over and beyond!!!
70792,43970819,2017-04-21T09:05:17Z,Unique historic property and charming welcoming hostess and family. Delightful!
70792,27170385,2017-04-19T09:51:40Z,"Fabulous private historic casa but neighborhood a bit tenuous, although felt safe enough and residence has electric gate with high walls. A bit noisy with traffic. There is an excellent restaurant very close. We like walkIng got so we did walk all the way to port for sunset and dinner by the bay. It was beautiful!
Nice breakfast in the morn and very lovely grounds. Artifacts thruout the home that you'll never get tired of looking at and wondering the grounds. Very personable family. Francesco picked us up on our walk back home after dinner! We are hoping to see them again in our way back to Roma from Sicily."
70792,37436062,2017-04-13T07:41:28Z,"The villa is truly a gem.  The decor is beautiful and the rooms are comfortable.  Emma and her husband were amazing hosts.  They graciously picked us up and dropped us off at the train station and also arranged for a lovely breakfast spread before our early departure.  The villa is a perfect location for visits to Herculaneum and Pompeii.  Herculaneum is a short walk away and Pompeii is a short metro ride away.  Even though we only stayed here one night, it was truly one of the highlights of our trip."

We arrived late and had agreed on dinner that has been served when we arrived that was nice as we was tired after trip. Breakfast was very good as well. Good place to check Naples, Vezuvio and Pompei. A bit expensive for stay with big family but otherwise great :)"
70792,15321205,2017-01-09T10:44:24Z,A truly unique property! The hosts were very friendly and made our stay comfortable and enjoyable!
70792,41577073,2016-11-19T09:55:46Z,"Emma's place is more than just a bed and breakfast.  Staying in this 17th century villa while visiting historic sites only adds to the feeling of a trip through time.  The pictures posted are just the beginning of the many rooms to explore, not to mention her lovely garden and the view of Vesuvius and Naples from the rooftop. The bus and train station are a short walk from the villa, and we had no trouble taking them to Naples.  Pompeii is a short drive on the highway; easy to find and park.  We were lucky enough to have a tour of the Amalfi Coast led by Emma's son, Francesco.  We highly recommend allowing him to escort you for the day!  For a special treat, allow Ms. Emma to cook dinner for you.  She makes a fresh fish dish and a pasta with broccoli that is out of this world.  We walked (about 20 minutes) to the Ercolano train station where we boarded a shuttle to get to the hiking trail  to the top of Mount Vesuvius.  Five hundred meters from the train station is the entrance to Herculaneum.  Along with the ruins and the volcano, we found wonderful restaurants and helpful local merchants in Portici.  After staying for a week, we felt just like family.  We definitely want to return and very highly recommend the villa as a base for exploring the Naples area."
70792,24796097,2016-11-05T09:58:59Z,"We love Emma's wonderful villa so much. The place is like an ancient gem and inside what you can see is truly a museum of family collections through a long time. The room on the 2nd floor is most spacious and nicely decorated and a private bathroom is attached also. Emma cook the best breakfasts we've had in Italy and her talents in cooking local delicacies are perfectly shown in the dinner she offered. Francesco had been so nice to us that he came to pick and see us off at the train station and introduced the local osteria to us. We missed our stay in the lovely portici so much and really want to go back. For cat and dog lovers, this is a wonderful place to stay for a couple of days; for music lovers, you are gonna hear elegant classical music during your stay. The train system running in Napoli is quite convenient and the station near the villa would easily take you to places as sorrento, then Capri and the Amalfi coast. Strongly recommend. "
70792,91175062,2016-10-27T07:11:48Z,The place was ok. It is very hard to find. Our gps could not find it and we had to stop a couple of times to ask for directions. If you are planning to explore the area it is better to have a car because train only works until 9:00 PM. 
70792,79605862,2016-10-17T07:22:38Z,"It was very easy to communicate with this B&B, and they were happy to answer all of my questions. They were kind enough to pick me up from the train station and bring me and my luggage to the villa, which is absolutely gorgeous! It's been in the family for several generations and is filled with an incredible collection of furniture, art, and antiques. I didn't have dinner there, but breakfast was very tasty. I wish I could've stayed longer than a night!"
70792,86751814,2016-10-14T08:43:37Z,"Emma's B&B is beautiful, inside & out. It is convenient for day trips in the area (Naples, Amalfi coast, archeological sites, Mt Vesuvius, etc.).  There is onsite parking if you have a car.  There are local restaurants and shops within walking distance. And, the breakfast is delicious!"
70792,73978422,2016-09-20T03:06:53Z,"Emma and her husband are just lovely.  They are great hosts, the house is just amazing.  There are not many opportunities to stay in and 18th century Villa.  

Warning... (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps takes you everywhere but the correct place when you put in the address.  It took us and every other guest that we spoke with 45 minutes to and hour of driving around to find the place.  Once we just searched for the name of the Villa in (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps, we were able to finally get there.  I think (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps has it as a two-way street verses a one-way.  The neighborhood is a little rough looking at first glance, but once you get inside the gate, you would never know. 

When you book, request to stay in the house.  We were given the apartment the first night, which is very private and has its own kitchen, but it does not have the charm or character of the house.  

Emma served a wonderful breakfast each day and upon request will cook dinner.  The dinner was fantastic.  Emma is a terrific cook.  We would also highly recommend the restaurant Pizzerini Tradizione, which is walking distance from the house.  One of the best dinners we had in Europe.  The owners and staff are outstanding.  We would come back to this area just to eat at the restaurant again. "
70792,860359,2016-09-12T06:09:11Z,"Home was beautiful as shown in photos. We had dinner two nights there,and it was wonderful. Emma is a very warm,welcoming woman. Her son picked us up and dropped us off-which helped greatly.  Thanks Francesco!
The town is not a tourist town. 
We never had any issues while out and about. "
70792,13543679,2016-08-28T07:41:10Z,"My husband and I highly recommend the Villa San Gennariello as a landing place perfectly positioned at the foot of Mt. Vesuvius with quick access to Naples and all points on the Amalfi Coast. If you're looking for old school Italian flair, this lovely B&B is the place for you. Emma and her family are fabulous hosts. We really enjoyed the hearty, delicious breakfast each morning of our stay, and relaxing in the gardens and on the rooftop terrace. The highlight for us, though, was Emma's home cooked, multi-course Italian dinner on our final night in Italy. The dinner was delicious and a great value. So, don't miss the chance to have her cook for you! "
70792,52454658,2016-08-01T07:25:06Z,"UNBELIEVABLE!!! INCREDIBLE!! AMAZING! Can't describe how fantastic this accomodation is in under 500 words. I have never met such friendly, hospitable people in my entire life. Truly felt apart of this family for the short stay and it was very saddening to leave. The pictures do not do this house justice. A grand house in a beautiful, quiet garden setting. The house was impeccably clean and well looked after. Every day the lovely cleaner would clean the whole house, including your own personal quarters. The breakfast was a delectable feast every morning and always welcomed by a smile.  The location is definition not in the heart of the naples for sure, but positioned in a beautiful, more tranquil area, which I personally prefer. The historic Herculaneum is only a 15 min walk away, and the local train is a 10 minute walk away and can be utilised to get to other sites such as Sorrento and Pompeii - 15 min train to napoli centrale!.I am eternally grateful for the six day experience. Grazie mille to Mimo, Francesco and Emma! I hope to be back soon!"
70792,49428918,2016-07-16T07:53:34Z,"This place is simply gorgeous, huge old villa full of history and artifacts. The host family runs this bnb as a full time gig and they have it down to perfection. Checking in and out was a breeze, and breakfast was delicious. My only apprehension about the experience was the area, we hadn't rented transportation and instead walked or took the bus or train, if you walk down the wrong street you can easily find yourself in some very sketchy areas, if you choose the right path however it's only a 15 minute walk from the breathtaking ruins of Herculaneum. Beyond that the space itself and the hospitality of Emma and her family made it an amazing experience, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "
70792,16774442,2016-07-15T04:50:33Z,we werden netjes opgehaald bij het station en kregen een heerlijk ontbijt. Zeer aardige mensen
70792,28564827,2016-07-13T08:37:10Z,"Uno de lo mejores alojamientos que he visitado en mis viajes. Perfecto para visitar Nápoles, Ercolano, Pompeya, además de Caserta. Puedes visitar las ciudades cercanas en tu coche ya que cuanta con garaje privado o ir en tren a la ciudad.

Villa San Gennariello esta decorada con sumo gusto, con habitaciones y espacios comunes amplios y limpios, sientes el esplendor del buen gusto italiano. 

Además cuenta con un magnifico jardín. La ultima noche cenamos fuera con la magnifica cocina de Emma, la anfitriona todo corazón y una excelente chef, con gusto por la cocina Italiana, además puedes probar el vino local de una cercana bodega, un descubrimiento fantástico.

El completo desayuno te da todas le energías que necesitas para conocer los lugares cercanos.

La familia de Emma, son todos encantadores y hacen que te sientas como en tu casa. 

Recomiendo como indispensable la Villa San Gennariello para cualquier visitante de Nápoles.




 "
70792,18644546,2016-06-17T09:36:23Z,"The stay at Emma's B&B was wonderful. 
She greeted us everyday with a fresh breakfast and a genuine smile.
She even cooked us dinner and served it outside on the beatiful garden patio. Her son, Francesco, spoke perfect English and was very helpful with recommendations of places to visit and eat.
The Villa is very large with high ceilings and many windows to allow in the cool breezes. It had a rooftop terrace with amazing views of the bay and Mt. Vesuvius. It was like being transported back to a more opulent time.
The Villa is located in an urban setting, just steps away from the busy streets and local color. The Circumvesuviana, which is Naples area commuter rail, is about a 10 minute walk. Herculeam, a smaller version of Pompeii, is also just a short 20 minute walk.
Sorrento is a 45 minute train ride away and 30 minute bus ride will take you to the rim of Vesuvius. "
12522,109737927,2017-04-25T16:03:11Z,"Nice place, excellent host!"
12522,120424427,2017-04-19T17:48:02Z,"Brenda's place is extremely clean and exactly as the photos show. Brenda was a great host and I enjoyed my time there. The location was very close to restaurants, shops, and places to have a drink. I did quite a bit of walking around the neighborhood and felt safe. The room itself was just what I needed as a single traveler. Highly recommended! "
12522,97080270,2017-04-12T17:56:41Z,"Great place, beautiful, clean, nice, safe neighbourhood close to public transport and shopping. "
12522,5773109,2017-04-04T15:17:40Z,"Highly recommended.  Perfect place to stay for my work trip.  Brenda is a kind, generous and friendly hostess and great conversationalist.  Her apartment is bright, very clean and well appointed while chock full of bay area charm.  Room is cute and cozy with comfy bed and tons of natural light.  It was the quiet respite I needed at the end of my long days. Perfect spot for a solo traveller.  Boo Dog is an adorable little sweetheart.  Would definitely book again! Thanks Brenda! "
12522,91492058,2017-03-29T15:42:58Z,"Loved staying here! The location was great and Brenda was super friendly. Great place to stay, easy to get around to different parts of the city."
12522,4877334,2017-03-21T18:37:08Z,Brenda was an awesome host! Couldn't ask for anything better. Her place is in a really great location and she's always available to give some really good recommendations on where to go and what to do.
12522,107913752,2017-03-08T18:30:38Z,Brenda was so kind and welcoming! Her place is perfectly located and I was able to find plenty of places to hang out/eat around the neighborhood. This was my first time in the city and Brenda made me feel at home and made sure I was okay. Would definitely love to stay here again in the future. 
12522,31127039,2017-03-02T17:26:44Z,What an amazing find! Brenda was super flexible and left me to my own devices. Really friendly and helpful plus the place is really nice! Full of character and peaceful. Excellent location. You must stay here!
12522,9965762,2017-02-22T18:49:33Z,"This was a great place to stay and Brenda was a great host. The only thing that may be a deterrent to some people is the number of steps in you need to climb in order to get to the main floor, but everything else was great. Clean bathroom, great nearby food, nightlife, public transport, and Zip Car stations. The only major downer I had was that it rained 95% of my visit, but that obviously cant be blamed on the host!

I would recommend this place highly!"
12522,114732938,2017-02-16T17:45:20Z,"Such a lovely place, and Brenda is a great host! "
12522,14954717,2017-02-15T18:33:52Z,Felt very welcome though arriving very late. Cosy room. I had a great stay!
12522,9968066,2017-02-08T16:53:56Z,Brenda was the best. The house was both beautiful and cozy. Brenda (and her adorable dog Boo) were awesome hosts. Definitely the best neighborhood (and maybe best block) in all of SF. I HIGHLY recommend Brenda's home.
12522,110442795,2017-01-31T16:51:12Z,"The house was really clean, comfortable, and warm. Brenda was really helping and friendly. I really enjoyed my time staying in Brenda's house. "
12522,4351133,2017-01-24T19:46:12Z, Great place to stay
12522,76620987,2017-01-13T18:35:49Z,Wonderful apartment. Wonderful host.
12522,46337281,2016-12-21T19:04:52Z,"It was a great time to live in Brenda's house. It is the prettiest house I've ever seen and it feels very warm, just like home. Brenda invited me for dinner the first day I got to SF and it was super nice of her. "
12522,92382103,2016-11-24T17:08:46Z,The room is very cozy and lovely. To stay here was one of my best experience in SF. She concerned if I stayed comfortably and I completely relaxed here. I’ll never forget staying this lovely house and her and her amazing dog and cat. 
12522,4390168,2016-11-16T10:13:53Z,Brenda's place is perfectly located for exploring San Francisco. Brenda and Matt made be feel most welcome. 
12522,7619542,2016-11-08T19:40:20Z,"Beautiful flat located between Castro and Mission area. Full of lovely art.  Brenda and her flatmate Matt are very welcoming and it's a great great location. Room and bed is small, but perfectly comfortable for a single person.  "
12522,39904832,2016-11-02T15:28:56Z,"The neighborhood was fantastic with many international dining restaurants and markets, just a few streets up from Sanchez. Brenda was very accomodating and welcoming the day of my arrival. She was very informative and sharing of her personal recommendations of things to do in the city. Also, I was really loving the cozy room decor and livingspace area. It was a pleasure experience staying with Brenda in San Francisco! "
542191,21346672,2017-04-30T01:52:42Z,This place was a lovely spot. Incredible views from the pool area. Would recommend this place in future. Wish i could stay longer. 
542191,52995492,2017-04-22T23:18:33Z,"Thank you so much Kerri-Lea.
This was my first experience on Air BnB and I absolutely loved it. I booked the Villa for myself and my family so we could spend some time together, relax and celebrate birthday's. The accommodation, view, pool, spa and everything about this booking was better than I thought it would be. Everything exceeded my imagination. 
Kerri-Lea was a wonderful host, the check in and check out was easy.
The Villa and pool/BBQ area is all well equipped. A wonderful place to stay, relax and take in the serenity. Could not recommend this place highly enough.
We also fell in love with your dog Jirra, who was just absolutely beautiful and so loveable.

Thanks again!"
542191,48925698,2017-04-15T22:53:15Z,"The location was absolutely fabulous! The loft room fit us 10 girls perfectly  The pool is amazing, so peaceful. You do have to share the outdoor area with the main house and king suite occupants but that was still fine! Had a great Hens weekend! Kerri-Lea is a fabulous host- great communication and always there to help when you need. Thankyou very much for a great weekend! "
542191,111501064,2017-03-12T01:27:29Z,"What can I say? It was truly a weekend to remember. The photos don't even do it justice. The view is breath taking and the facilities were phenomenal. I wanted a place that felt away but was easy to get to and I got exactly that! Couldn't have asked for a more wonderful host. Easy to communicate with, always happy to help and she does everything to make your stay about you. I couldn't recommend this beautiful place highly enough! 
Rachael x "
542191,104720905,2017-03-06T00:52:20Z,Absolutely incredible house! Kerri-Lea was the best host ever. I had a hens weekend that I will truly never forget! Thank you for everything - hopefully one day we will be back.
542191,31156322,2017-02-26T00:33:19Z,"The house consists of a open plan living room/kitchen, single bathroom and a large upstairs room where all the beds are. There is AC throughout. Please keep this in mind if you're a large group of adults as privacy is limited. The places really shines when your outside. With a covered area including coffee table, bar, huge BBQ and ipod dock overlooking the mountains and that splendid pool, outdoors is where you want to be. There is a large 9 seater table with umbrella closer to the main house and a 9 person hot tube built into the deck for when the nights are colder. Kerri-Lea was a fantastic host getting us settled in and then leaving us to it."
542191,709561,2017-02-05T01:00:26Z,"Amazing venue with stunning views and a gorgeous pool. Kerri-Lea is amazingly warm and helpful - Her communication was great, she was very flexible with check in and check out and there were so many lovely little touches added to our stay. This wasn't my first stay, and I'll be back again!"
542191,107436553,2017-01-28T22:21:32Z,"Thank you! The property and views were amazing, was the perfect place for the relaxing trip my partner and I were looking for."
542191,17700941,2017-01-27T01:05:36Z,Everything was great! Especially the pool and the outdoor area.
542191,1882151,2017-01-10T00:18:10Z,"Gorgeous views and location, great pool and outdoor area, friendly and helpful host - we had a very relaxing time"
542191,98099262,2016-12-17T22:59:43Z,Can't speak highly enough of Kerri-Lee and this place. The views will take your breath away and the serenity is indescribable. We can't wait to come back!
542191,43474108,2016-12-05T01:42:34Z,"Lovely venue, Kerri-lea allowed myself to celebrate my 30th party & I was able to invite a few friends to this beautiful location. Myself & my family stayed in the villa, & everyone was impressed with the views & the place it's self. Thank you so much :) "
542191,101509296,2016-11-23T22:58:51Z,"The host she is really nice, as soon as she got my booking and got reply me within one hour, she made her promise on the website are all 100%. The house is massive, it's magnificent, no matter from the front pool, private chill zone, spa, mountain view, or cool fresh back yard are more beautiful than the pics.  Price is really worth it. The best place for a relax vocation. "
542191,21393383,2016-11-19T22:29:55Z,"Such an amazing spot!! The best weekend, lost count of how many times we all commented on how beautiful it was. The pool, spa, tramp, fire pit - everything was just perfect. Kerri was so accomodating, and will most certainly be coming back to stay again! "
542191,53225024,2016-11-12T22:33:00Z,"On arrival we were greeted by Kerri-Lea and our first impression of the property was WOW! We had a fantastic girls weekend away, and spent the whole time relaxing around the property enjoying all the amenities. We look forward to coming back annually. "
542191,82005769,2016-10-17T05:51:58Z,"My group of girlfriends and I had a wonderful weekend stay (for a hen’s weekend) at this property and Kerri-Lea was an absolutely fantastic host.  Our group booked both the loft and king studio to ensure we had exclusive use and were able to relax, have lots of laughs and make as much noise as we liked.  The outdoor entertainment area was superb with the infinity pool, hot tub, ample seating/chill out spaces and the hinterland views were stunning.  This property more than accommodated our large group and we will definitely be returning for further stays here.  I would highly recommend this property and Kerri-Lea as a fantastic host for anyone looking a great place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the Gold Coast or City.  "
542191,1371989,2016-10-10T09:16:39Z,"We loved our short stay at this beautiful home. Kerri-Lea went out of her way to make our arrival special, was very accomodating during our stay, and we were impressed with the thought that went into ensuring her guests had everything they needed for the stay, even providing sarongs and dressing gowns.

The pool and pavilion were fantastic spaces to relax with a barbecue, and her dog was very friendly and happy to keep us company.

We'd certainly come back to stay again."
542191,34325880,2016-10-04T08:43:11Z,The villa is located int the mountain with a great view. The swimming pool is really nice. Kids can do horse feeding nearby. Kerri-Lea prepared a detailed instruction guide book for guests with much helpful information inside. She is reachable during the whole stay. One recommendation might be to inform the guests that please wait for a while after several people taking shower because we are using electrical water heater. Thanks for everything 
542191,32219120,2016-09-20T08:14:33Z,"We had my sisters Hens party here. There was 6 of staying and Kerri let us have a party with a few others coming! It was the most amazing location, The pictures are gorgeous but just does not do it justice! It is simply breath taking. Kerri was totally accommodating making sure she made us feel comfortable and was always there to help make the music louder hehe The house is spacious, we cooked bacon and eggs every morning with ease and woke up after a beautiful sleep as all the beds were so comfy. She even had robes hanging up for us. The jacuzzi is awesome looking over the beautiful mountains and horses. It was just serene! All of us girls are very excited about it and already planning the next visit! Thank you so much Kerri and your house is just beautiful and cosy! xxx "
542191,15869939,2016-09-12T03:40:34Z,We had an absolutely wonderful stay! Kerri-Lea couldn't be more lovely and the place was perfect! Did not want to leave
4694846,29270030,2017-05-06T02:18:40Z,"If you are up north in Bali you must go here! It is so incredible, ari and Kim are so helpful as well as their staff who cooked us 3 meals a day in our private villa! The pool was amazing and the view. It was so clean and comfortable I will be back again. This gets an 11/10 from us!"
4694846,47085966,2017-05-03T03:03:58Z,"This villa is just amazing! The greatest villa in North Bali for sure. Amazing mornings and stunning sunsets. Great hospitality and super friendly and supportive host team. Great interior, modern design decisions and solutions. 

Regarding road it is truly bad for 1.5 km, difficult access, but it's totally worth it! The greatest sunset view we have ever seen. We were travelling on enduro bike, and it was one of the best choice in our life for sure. If you travel by you own, we would suggest to use transfer service provided by villa hosts. "
4694846,5532876,2017-04-26T01:10:37Z,"My friends and I spent one week at the villa 2 and it was just amazing. We were a group of 8 students and wanted to have a nice time together without the trouble in the south and this place is just perfect. The pictures don't do their justice and one can't get enough of the view. the staff was extremely helpful and we felt extremely well take care of. Beyond amazing was the communication with Ari, who in all of my airbnb time, was the best host. He was always reachable (He gave us a cell phone with balance to call him and the staff) and was very helpful with the organization of trips and other activities as well as transfer. 
Another astonishing thing were the skills of the drivers. We usually needed two cars and those guys are amazing. As the last road to the villa is very bumpy and especially the first time gets to you, the guys know exactly how to handle the cars and even when one of our group needed to go down very early due to a diving trip, he was taken by one of the guys with a motorcross bike (he loved the exciting ride, guess it is nothing for soft nerves though :D ). 
The area is rather sleepy and don't expect the Seminyak/Kuta athmosphere there, as it is very quite there. When you are within a group though and want to spend some quality time with each other, this is an amazing place.

All in all, we would definitely go back and can highly recommend this place.

Once again: Huge, huge thank you to Ari and his crew for this amazing stay."
4694846,24070731,2017-04-20T11:25:54Z,"This villa is simply outstanding! From the friendlyness of the helpful staff over the stunning views and the fantastic food, it was fabulous! Ari is a great host and was always there for us! Thank you so much! Make sure you try the In house massage; that was fantastic too! "
4694846,78936884,2017-04-16T00:49:02Z,"My wife and I had the greatest time for my birthday. Words cannot describe the amazing experience we had. From the fresh meals everyday to the gecko noises, it was all amazing. If you want to relax this is the place to go "
4694846,46877375,2017-04-08T01:31:09Z,"We had a fabulous time the 7 days we were there!  Ari, Luh and the staff were amazing."
4694846,2771113,2017-03-30T02:40:42Z,"I would recommend this place to any one traveling to Bali! Amazing place to live with totally great staff!

If you are going there, be sure to ask for transport. It's affordable, comfortable and a safe way to get there.

We stayed for two weeks at this fantastic place. Made excursions every other day that Ari with staff helped us out with. We had the time of our life here. Fantastic views, wonderful living, great food and lovely staff.

We will miss the ""Ge-Co's"" during the evenings!
"
4694846,14379778,2017-03-15T04:16:55Z,"The villa was absolutely beautiful! Pictures are exactly what you get :) 

We were greeted by Luh and the girls who were incredibly friendly and attentive. Ari couldn't be there to greet us but he made sure to make a phone call to say hello and welcome us to the villa. We were also given a cell phone to use for our stay to contact Ari or Luh and that came in handy :) 

We spent my 30th Birthday there, and the staff made me a beautiful cake and sang. Thank you for that!
All the meals were incredible too!

We arranged for their driver daily, and Gede was wonderful. He took us wherever we wanted to go and when we changed our minds about our destination, he was very willing to accommodate. 

The only draw back to this villa is the drive. It's approx 3.5hrs from the airport and about 1hr from the closest town. The last few kilometers of the road to the villa is very bumpy. But we knew most of this going in so it wasn't a surprise to us.
I promise you the drive is worth it though!

Also any minor issues we had with our stay were immediately resolved by Ari. Thank you so much for an incredible stay and hour hospitality.

My family and I had a wonderful time at the villa! If we come back to Bali we will stay again!"

4694846,46875150,2017-03-09T02:33:53Z,"We stayed at the villa for three nights. The villa was absolutely beautiful and the view was even better! The pictures don't do it justice! The villa was in a very remote location and I would recommend using their driver to get there because they know the road and it is slightly treacherous. We also took a day trip organized by Ari and the driver was great and I would highly recommend both the waterfalls and hot springs. Overall, fabulous experience! "
4694846,94993318,2017-03-06T01:05:23Z,"Helt fantastisk vy. Och vilket ställe. Kan inget annat än att rekommendera detta ställe. Ari och övriga värdar gör allt för att ni får en trevlig vistelse. 
Tack för att vi fick vara här. 
Mattias. "
4694846,42260586,2017-03-03T02:56:07Z,"This place is like a paradise to us. After a long drive, the villa is just at the top of a mountain. You could just sit in the sofa at the second floor and watch the forest and the sea at the same time. Food was also quite delicious and the crew are always there ready to help. One night is just simply not enough for us. We would totally go back  when we come back to Bali. "

4694846,60206,2017-02-03T00:36:49Z,"Not much can be said other than all of the amazing reviews are true and very justified! Totally agree that using their driver makes the most sense- the road to the villa is very bad and their guys are great and know how to navigate it- the road from ubud is fairly winding also so we found it useful to have someone driving who was very familiar with it. 
The villa is magnificent, the view and pool are stunning and we are in the whole time and the food and staff were fantastic.  It's a very special place! "
4694846,77901080,2017-01-29T02:00:11Z,"No photos could do justice to the truly breathtaking view from this villa, and no words could fully capture what an incredible villa this is. Every piece of furniture,  every service provided, and all the cooking is of the very highest standard.  We can't wait to return!"
4694846,3086663,2017-01-13T02:30:01Z,"If you don't have a big jeep, do contact the hosts directly to use their small shuttle from the bottom or hire their driver ! By the look of the hill, no regular taxis or Uber will want to drive up there and don't risk scratching your car! 

For the rest, OH MY GOD! What an amazing space! We were four adults and their is more than enough room to enjoy! 

The design is impeccable, the staff are lovely, their food is amazing! Will go back for sure!!!!! 

"
4694846,18227876,2016-12-30T09:58:27Z,"After a very bumpy ride for the last few k's.. we arrived at the Villa and it was just as it looks in the pictures - absolutely stunning! I recommend arriving during the day as we arrived at night and thought we may die on the road up there haha! 

Our stay was so relaxing and peaceful and Ari was on hand to help us with anything we might need, although we never actually got to meet him - but he replied quickly to messages and was very helpful. The staff were all very nice and helpful too.

There was a HUGE spider in one of the rooms so I slept in the other room.. it moved in ways far too creepy to negotiate with a cup and piece of paper. We didnt mind though, you have to expect a few critters. 

Overall a wonderful stay, a beautiful spot, and we will definitely be back! We miss the view already! :-)"
4694846,81008784,2016-12-30T02:39:00Z,"I can honestly say this is the nicest place I've ever stayed in. Both the villa and the view were absolutely breathtaking. My girlfriend and I enjoyed total privacy, while indulging in the luxurious facilities and taking in the stunning views lounging around the infinity pool. If you're after something secluded and private then you can't go past this place. The road in was a little tricky to maneuver while doubling my girlfriend on the scooter with our bags wedged on board, but the staff were happy to drive my girlfriend and our bags back to the main road when we left, while I rode the scooter. If riding a scooter in, I would suggest maybe calling ahead to ask them to pick you up at the top of the road. A minor issue on an unforgettable stay, and all part of the experience anyway."
4694846,64914841,2016-12-20T01:31:26Z,Felt incredibly welcome and was checked up on. Ari went above and beyond to help us with lost baggage and make sure we all arrived safely!
4694846,1838070,2016-12-18T00:39:12Z,"An absolute paradise and epitome of the true Bali culture. The villa is beyond beautiful, words truly cannot describe how stunning the view is. The staff are like family and offer hospitality that is a one of a kind experience. Ari and his staff set up day trips, offered recommendations and went above and beyond to make us feel at home. Amazing food also defiantly order the BBQ. This place is perfection cannot wait to come back. Ari & Kim thank you so much for everything we loved our stay! For anyone looking to stay in Northern Bali this is your place!"
12351,7193430,2017-05-01T02:31:27Z,"The location was great! So close to everything. And the hosts were both flexible, and gracious. Just remember, there are steep stairs to the toilet in the middle of the night, but the lighting is designed to help!"
12351,33081087,2017-04-28T03:58:01Z,Good value place with really nice view
12351,88372849,2017-04-24T01:14:23Z,"Host were accommodating and friendly.  Amenities such as washer and dryer avaliable. Coffee, tea and breakfast supplies were also provided. Location was excellent,close to public transport,groceries and restaurants"
12351,61041162,2017-04-21T12:01:18Z,Die Lage der Unterkunft ist kaum zu toppen. Das Zimmer ist allerdings sehr hellhörig sodass man Pech haben kann wenn andere Gäste sehr laut sind.
12351,86034483,2017-04-11T22:43:24Z,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Stuart and Vinh's place in Pyrmont. A beautiful house in a great location, and good value for money with breakfast provided. "
12351,7000493,2017-04-08T23:13:47Z,Loved having a quiet coffee early morning in the garden...great views. Very central location- we walked everywhere in the city.
12351,2645441,2017-04-05T01:09:12Z,"Vinh and Stuart have a nice home in a interesting neighborhood of Sydney.  It is a little bit further than expected for most sights and activities in the main part of Sydney, but the neighborhood was very nice nonetheless.  The Wifi was also slow, if that is important to you.  However, I appreciate them making me feel welcome and enjoyed being able to use the kitchen or sit on the back deck.  "
12351,26075869,2017-03-31T22:29:08Z,Very nice bedroom with balcony looking to street.  Clean and WiFi. 
12351,53874781,2017-03-29T23:09:17Z,Great for a quick stay in Sydney with very friendly and helpful hosts! 
12351,45575215,2017-03-26T23:23:14Z,"Great location, just a few minutes walk to Pyrmont bridge and Darling Harbour. Extremely accommodating, hospitable and friendly hosts. Although we only booked a room, it felt as though we had the whole house to ourselves. Great value compared to other places in Pyrmont. "
12351,3996477,2017-03-24T21:42:00Z,Nous sommes retournés chez Stuart à l'issue de notre périple.  Ils sont toujours aussi sympathiques et attentionnés. Une très bonne adresse à Sydney.
12351,103654396,2017-03-21T00:41:12Z,"Great location, short walk from Darling harbour and onwards to the CBD/Tourist areas beyond would already make this a great place to stay. However add to that two very gracious hosts and a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere within the house and you have a winner!"
12351,113293910,2017-03-15T21:50:45Z,This was my first time using this service and the location of Stuart's place was perfect. You are able to walk to everything or easily use the transit system in Sydney. They are wonderful host's and very helpful in helping first visitors navigate the city. I would return and recommend them in the future.  
12351,66843246,2017-03-11T22:10:48Z,Perfect location for relaxing and walkable distance to the city. Very friendly hosts.
12351,30301567,2017-03-10T00:47:18Z,"Close enough to everything centrally( 40 minutes walk to harbour) but bus on doorstep takes you halfway. Vinh gives you opal card which you preload for transport. Recommend I'm free walking tour from town hall at 10.30 . Gives you great overview. Had useful tips and nice meal / drinkfrom Tim at Barzini which is 5 minutes away. 
Instructions on how to get to house are fantastic. Thanks Stuart and Vinh. Greathosts"
12351,66638647,2017-03-04T21:32:53Z,"If you are into the Arts, especially visual art, Stuart and Vinh's home is the place to stay. You will love the ambience. Their home is full of books.  Just by the harbour, you can get anywhere quickly by rail link (tram) and train. Two stops to Pyrmont Bay and the ferry across the harbour. Stuart and Vinh are lovely, generous-hearted hosts. "
12351,74071393,2017-02-23T21:54:51Z,"很好的一次经历,位置非常好,院子后面就是海岸,早上或者夕阳的时候只是在房子附近散步都是很好的选择。房东非常贴心,我们预定是在10点退房,但是得知我们是晚上8点的飞机后,他们就允许我们把行李放在他们家里。你还可以在这吃早餐!他们还给我们提供吐司,各种麦片和咖啡~"
12351,26250440,2017-02-21T21:34:53Z,A big thank you to Stuart and Vinh for their welcome. The apartment is quiet and the location is perfect to visit Sydney. Easy to access to the public transport. We would come back anytime.
12351,8497468,2017-02-20T19:17:02Z,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
12351,8859509,2017-02-16T00:34:12Z,"Vinh and Stuart were polite and helpful. Their place has a great view of the water and they have all the things you'd need for a comfortable stay including drinks and snacks.  If you're going to be working near or visiting Pyrmont, this is a reliable choice for your stay. "
1257480,14048607,2017-04-16T09:00:30Z,"Отличная квартира, очень уютная и атмосферная. Есть все необходимое. Очень удобное расположение, основные достопримечательности, улицы и рестораны в шаговой доступности. Дополнительный бонус – музыкальное училище в доме напротив. Так что, идя по двору, можно наслаждаться классической музыкой.
Нам с мужем все очень понравилось.
Большое спасибо!"
1257480,107805982,2017-04-03T07:21:10Z,"The apartment is amazing - it's clean, right in the heart of Minsk, looks very cosy and is decorated with taste. Julia is a great host, always eager to help and recommend taxis, public transport, or give some tips. She responds very quickly and is always polite. I'll definitely recommend her and this apartment to anyone who's going to stay in Minsk."
1257480,113624972,2017-03-26T05:21:17Z,"Очень уютная, симпатичная квартира с приятной атмосферой. Все удобства есть, но санузел немного тесноват. Расположение - лучше не придумаешь! Всё рядом! У нас был вечерний самолет, и Юлия без проблем разрешила оставить вещи. Спасибо! Нам все понравилось!"
1257480,24768291,2017-03-04T07:20:36Z,"Perfect host, place and stay. "
1257480,9905833,2017-02-19T07:41:27Z,"Отличное место, квартира небольшая, но очень интересная!
Отличный дизайн и месторасположение, все близко и можно легко дойти пешком!
Хозяйка очень отзывчивая и гостеприимная!"
1257480,101875025,2017-02-03T08:27:31Z,Very nice apartment. Cosy and relaxing. 
1257480,26189770,2017-01-26T07:39:56Z,"Julia's place is brilliant! I had a very comfortable stay.. 
Julia also went out of her way to assist me with the visa application, very kind lady. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to see Minsk. Thank you so much again Julia."
1257480,15481719,2017-01-15T08:37:12Z,"I've been visiting Minsk now for 6 years for work and I've rented many apartments, but Julia's place was by far best experience I've had, the studio was so cosy beautifully designed and well furnished that I really looked forward to coming home. Its also near some great bars and a wonderful restaurants  such as Bistro Deluxe at the end of the street, I will  most differently  stay there again. Julia also welcomes you with a big warm smile "
1257480,3632954,2017-01-06T06:52:47Z,"Очень уютная и милая квартира с книгами по физике. Прекрасное расположение. Все было отлично, спасибо."
1257480,2357783,2017-01-01T05:33:16Z,Good room in centre.
1257480,31609987,2016-12-25T08:49:27Z,"Рекомендую для творческих людей, влюбленных пар"
1257480,15033478,2016-11-27T05:08:57Z,"Small, but very cozy studio for a solo traveller or a couple. Perfect location in the city center. Close to everything. "
1257480,58516408,2016-11-17T02:43:11Z,Other than the stairwell which really isn't very nice we loved everything about our stay at Julia's apartment. Great location the Tapas restaurant is really good. Julia was really helpful with providing us paperwork for our visas. If we went to Minsk again we would definitely return. Thanks
1257480,99752180,2016-10-29T07:48:45Z,Квартира обладает особой атмосферой. Хочется останавливаться ещё 
1257480,22450328,2016-10-28T06:09:17Z,"Eine sehr gute Lage für die Erkundung von Minsk, einmal um die Ecke und man ist im Zentrum. Die Wohnung ist ruhig gelegen, gemütlich. Wir haben uns wohl gefühlt, Danke !"
1257480,21309167,2016-10-21T08:00:31Z,"Очень интересная квартира в самом центре Минска. Рядом есть все, что нужно. Понравилось фортепиано в хорошем состоянии. Единственный минус - это чистота в квартире, много пыли и не самая тщательная уборка."
1257480,2237005,2016-10-17T06:20:05Z,"Julia's studio had everything we needed for our short stay in Minsk. It's only a few steps from all of the central sights and historic places. It is compact and fits a kitchenette, lounge area and bedroom – all onto a quite small space, but doesn't feel crowded. It's only minus is due to that that from the pictures you expect it to be bigger. The bathroom could also have a bit more space as the little shelf below the mirror makes it quite hard to bend your head towards the sink :D But maybe that's just me. Julia and her husband were patient and accommodating, fixing the heating before we arrived and just overall nice people. "
1257480,53058188,2016-10-13T06:45:22Z,Юлия очень гостеприимная и приятная по общению! Квартира  полностью оправдала наши ожидания. Прекрасный интерьер и расположение. Рекомендую!
1257480,94756112,2016-09-25T08:23:23Z,"Наша первая поездка в Минск была очень удачной. Пешком быстро дошли до дома от вокзала, без проблем все нашли. Квартира очень уютная, с множеством интересных деталей, которые хочется рассматривать. Книги - отдельный пункт, который стоит отметить.  Все соответствует фото. 
Более удачного расположения трудно представить для тех, кто впервые приезжает в город и хочет осмотреть за короткую поездку главные достопримечательности. Вокруг много интересных кафе с изумительной кухней и великолепным обслуживанием. Спасибо хозяйке за гостеприимство, отзывчивость:) "
1257480,78080557,2016-09-22T08:16:42Z,"Nice apartment, great central location. "
1169704,55671906,2017-05-07T12:20:32Z,My experience was wonderfully easy and carefree. The location is excellent. Gorgeously decorated.
1169704,15992841,2017-05-01T09:27:26Z,"Lola's place was great, it is very close to the centre of town and very clean and comfortable. We were only two people, but there's definitely enough space for four comfortably. If we come to Avignon again we will try to stay here. We also took up Lola on her restaurant recommendation and had a great meal. Thanks Lola!"
1169704,1390357,2017-04-30T08:44:19Z,"We had an amazing stay in Avignon and in Lola's gorgeous apartment. Lola was very thoughtful and easy to communicate with. The apartment is even more beautiful than the photos show - if that's possible. It was very clean, comfortable and had all of the amenities we needed. The neighborhood is a perfect location to walk around the main town. 

Lola left a book of wonderful recommendations for restaurants, shops and things to do in Avignon, which was so helpful. One of the places she recommended was a flea market not far from her place, which was so much fun. 

I hope to visit Avignon again and stay at Lola's apartment. I would highly recommend it to anyone. "
1169704,104479511,2017-04-27T09:47:57Z,"很棒很舒的公寓,廚房用品非常完繕,地點也非常好,入住也方便,我很推薦"
1169704,111369135,2017-04-22T07:41:02Z,Schön eingerichtet und sehr Zentral gelegen 
1169704,45646781,2017-04-18T09:07:42Z,"Lola's apartment is beautiful and comfortable. It is about 2 minutes walk to the information and 5 minutes walk to the train station. The location is excellent, but there is no elevator and carrying heavy suitcase up 3 flights of stairs is difficult! Overall we had great experience staying her and recommended it for others and would definitely stay here again. "
1169704,113584585,2017-04-14T06:42:32Z,"Great location! 10 minute walk with luggage from train station and just a few steps away from the fun in town center. Clean, lovely interior. Had everything we needed for a short overnight stay. Only con - a bit too perfumed for my preference in the apartment. "
1169704,73273464,2017-04-12T07:48:04Z,"Lola was a great host, a fast communicator and very helpful when my wife needed an emergency dental appointment. The apartment was everything it promised to be, central, quiet, clean and sunny. The kitchen had  everything needed to cook and the apartment in general was warm, large and comfortable. I highly recommend this apartment and Lola as host. If ever we are back in Avignon we hope Lola's place is available. "
1169704,17022596,2017-04-05T09:17:05Z,"The apartment was right in the heart of Avignon, an easy walk from all the sights, shopping, cafes, etc. It was well equipped with a very comfortable bed and cute decor. Parking was pay parking out on the street but was very close by."
1169704,120290075,2017-04-04T08:50:30Z,The is a very charming space that looks exactly as it is described.  Great location in a wonderful little town.  I highly recommend it.
1169704,23629571,2017-04-01T08:59:21Z,"If you're travelling to Avignon and Lola's apartment is available - just book it. You will not regret it. Spacious, well appointed, beautiful apartment. An absolute highlight of our three weeks in France. I would return to Avignon just to stay here again! Comfortable bed & more living space than we knew what to do with after two weeks of tiny French apartments. Thank you, Lola! "
1169704,2108752,2017-03-29T08:35:49Z,"Séjour parfait. Vrai petit cocon au coeur d'Avignon, je recommande vivement! "
1169704,15831634,2017-03-27T03:54:03Z,Lovely stay! Wish we could stay longer!
1169704,49466695,2017-03-21T10:28:20Z,Très joli appartement décoré avec beaucoup de goût.  Son emplacement est idéal à deux pas de l'artère la plus importante de la ville. Tout se fait à pied en partant de cet appartement.  Je le recommande sans restriction aucune.
1169704,32185229,2017-03-19T08:07:37Z,Excellent accueil ! Appartement charmant et au calme !! Deco de qualité et emplacement idéal !! A réserver les yeux fermés ;-)
1169704,8292158,2017-03-18T09:22:11Z,"Well located in the middle of the old town, clean, comfortable, and lovely decor. We wished we could have stayed longer! "
1169704,20117132,2017-03-16T10:08:45Z,"Lola's flat is absolutely adorable, and more than perfect for a couple to escape into Avignon. The apartment is beautifully decorated and very contemporary in a way that still feels quintessentially French.

The location is just blocks away from anywhere you'd want to be inside the city walls, but it's far enough away from the main tourist zone to allow for a quiet evening in restaurants frequented by locals.

Lola was the most communicative and helpful AirBnB host I've encountered to date.

We'll absolutely stay again if we find our way back to Avignon. Worth it, hands down."
1169704,6901716,2017-03-15T08:33:42Z,"Lola's apartment is beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom has a great shower with amenities that all smell like lavender :) The location is a bit secluded but that makes it quiet and the main street and the train station are just a short 2-minute walk away. Would definitely stay here again!"
1169704,18859555,2017-03-13T07:06:45Z,Apartment in a great location. Walking distance to all of Avignon. Really nice detailed and equipped apartment. 
1169704,24997974,2017-03-10T10:42:23Z,we loved the apartment's industrial design. Location was great and the apartment was spotless clean
1048435,72543020,2017-04-30T09:54:37Z,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Das süße Häuschen hat alles, was für eine entspannte Zeit auf der Insel nötig ist.
Es ist schön ruhig, mitten in der Natur mit schönen Bäumen.
Tomeu war ein sehr netter Vermieter, der uns morgens auch mal mit frischen Ensaimada überraschte.
Alles in allem, ist der Ort sehr liebevoll, gemütlich  und praktisch eingerichtet und für wen es wichtig ist, WLan funktioniert richtig gut dort.
"
1048435,58085419,2017-04-24T08:37:37Z,Tomeu ist ein super netter und unkomplizierter Gastgeber. Die liebevoll und gemütlich eingerichtete kleine Finca ist ruhig gelegen mit viel Natur drumherum; ideal zum Entspannen und Ausspannen. WLAN vorhanden.
1048435,30137062,2017-04-16T01:34:28Z,"Tolle Lage inmitten der Natur am Rande von Lloseta, morgens kräht der Hahn und man ist von viel Grün umgeben. Tomeu ist äußerst nett und sehr hilfsbereit. Das Häuschen ist mit viel Geschmack eingerichtet. Ein großer Raum plus Bad, aber ausreichend, wenn man hier vor allem schläft und Ausflüge macht - bei schönem Wetter gibt es dann die Terrasse vor dem Haus."
1048435,16207175,2017-04-05T09:23:16Z,"The house of Tomeu is situated just beautiful. To be honest - it is even more beautiful than on the pictures. We have stayed here with our little son (Tomeu provided us with a small bed for the child). The surrounding neighborhood is very calm and beautiful for (evening) walks. The house itself was very clean and with lovely details. However, in colder days we can imagine that it could get a bit chilly and you need to use the air conditioning or the fire place."
1048435,45226708,2017-04-04T07:49:42Z,"Wir waren fast 3 Wochen in Lloseta im Independant cottage. Die Unterkunft ist ideal, um mit dem Auto in kurzer Zeit alle Gegenden Mallorcas zu erkunden. Die Abende waren noch kühl, doch dank heizender Klimaanlage, Kamin und warmer Bettdecke gut zu ertragen. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und können diese Unterkunft sehr empfehlen."
1048435,61962549,2017-03-13T07:38:25Z,Alles okay
1048435,21043946,2017-03-06T10:07:58Z,"Das sehr kleine Häuschen, 1 Zimmer mit separatem Bad,  steht in einem baumbestandenen Garten außerhalb des Ortes. Es ist sehr sauber und nett eingerichtet. Der Kamin ist toll. Gefrühstückt haben wir auf der Terrasse vor dem Haus in der Morgensonne. Das Geschirr in der Küchenzeile ist ziemlich improvisiert untergebracht, für ausgiebigere Kochaktionen nicht geeignet.
Tomeu ist ein sehr freundlicher und zuvorkommender Gastgeber,  hat uns z. B. auf Nachfrage einen Haartrockner besorgt.
Ein kleines Manko: Der Kühlschrank im Zimmer, in dem man ja auch schläft,  war relativ laut. 
Alles in allem aber sonst nett und empfehlenswert, wenn man die Abgeschiedenheit mag."
1048435,61397056,2017-02-25T04:21:13Z,"Very nice cottage on the countryside, with a fireplace, good kitchen and facilities. Tomeu is a good and accomodating host. Wifi works on and off due to radio coverage in the area. We had a wonderful time."
1048435,22138385,2017-02-08T07:56:11Z,"Tomeu and his son were extremely gracious hosts, and very generous with their time to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay. 

The place is lovely and relaxing, in a beautiful setting. It's about 20-25 mins walk from Lloseta - was a little bracing in the cooler weather when the wind was blowing a bit of a gale, but in fair weather was a lovely walk. We were after a relaxing, low key few days , but if you want to explore local towns or don't like walking a car is recommended. 

The place does get quite cold in cooler weather. The open fire place is a treat, but it does get a bit messy and smokey and be prepared to chop your own wood!

If you go during the winter though like we did, be prepared to bring warm clothes and thick socks/slippers, since the cottage is just warm enough."
1048435,18302599,2017-01-28T08:29:33Z,"It was beautiful !!! Everything like described even more prettier .. We enjoyed the stay and could relax by the fire place ... I recommend it to everybody who wants to get away from the busy cities and enjoy the peacefulness of the place!!!! 

We be back!!❤️ "
1048435,105005772,2017-01-15T10:08:21Z,Tomeu is a really good host. The stay was wonderfull and we even received a nice ensaimada (mallorcan sweet bread) one morning. Thanks!! 
1048435,1853529,2017-01-08T10:03:03Z,"Wir waren daheim noch der Meinung, dass es recht kuschlig wird in diesem Steinhaus.
Leider aber war es eben nicht so bei uns (1.Jännerwoche 2017). Es war schon frisch drinnen. Wir hatten die AC (als Heizung eben; obwohl doch eher laut) laufend an, aber es wurde nicht richtig warm (das Gerät vl etwas überfordert für die Größe des Raumes), die Luft auch dann sehr trocken.. Die erste Nacht haben wir mit Hauben, Fleecejacken und Jogginghose geschlafen. Übertags waren wir drinnen auch immer mit Pullover unterwegs.. Wir hätten uns erwartet, dass es besser funktioniert in dem Steinhaus im Winter.

Tomeu war schon bemüht, hat uns einmal noch eine Decke vorbeigebracht, aber das hat uns auch nicht so viel geholfen. Es war einfach nicht so wirklich gemütlich.

Obwohl das Haus lieb ist, schön eingerichtet und sauber. Am Mittwoch haben wir auch die berühmte Mehlspeise bekommen. Tomeu ist auch sehr nett.
Aber ja, in Summe war's für uns leider trotzdem nicht so toll. Wäre im Sommer besser gewesen."
1048435,4535438,2016-12-30T08:13:58Z,A charming cottage on a quiet small holding outside Llosetta.  It was the perfect place for our kids to roam and the house was well equipped and beautifully decorated.  The hosts were very kind and spoilt us with a local breakfast treat one morning.  Llosetta is only an hour away from Palma at the foot of the mountains and we can highly recommend it to people looking for something rustic away from the crowds.
1048435,2876334,2016-12-15T08:28:07Z,"Lo hemos pasado de maravilla en la casa de Tomeu. Todo estuvo como en las fotos. Tomeu es muy sympatico y la communicacion era muy facil! 100% podemos recomendar este sitio y seguro que volveremos :). 

Wir haben eine wunderbare Zeit in Tomeus Unterkunft verbracht. Alles entsprach den zuvor gesehenen Bildern. Tomeu ist sehr sympathisch und die Kommunikation mit ihm klappte problemlos und einfach. Wir können diese Unterkunft zu 100% weiterempfehlen und werden sicher wiederkommen :)."
1048435,102948971,2016-12-09T09:48:26Z,"La llegada a la casita fue maravillosa, Tomeu me estaba esperando en el lugar acordado y fuimos juntos a conocer mi lugar de vacaciones, me encantó enseguida, pues estaba todo totalmente a punto para mi llegada; es tal cual se ve en el anuncio, completamente igual, estaba también muy aseado y me sentí muy cómoda en todo momento; Tomeu se ofreció para ayudarme en todo lo que necesitara, y de verdad que la recomiendo a quien quiera pasar unos días de tranquilidad, soledad, y estar en contacto con la naturaleza, también parece un lugar ideal para ir en pareja, pues el muy romántico; en coche estás al lado del pueblo, e incluso si quieres ir dando un paseo también lo puedes  hacer; también me sentí muy segura, pues no tuve ninguna molestia de nadie; sólo me queda dar las gracias a Tomeu por su amable hospitalidad , un abrazo."
1048435,89892675,2016-12-04T10:36:30Z,"Tomeu welcomed us very friendly, gave a lot of restaurant and must see tips on Mallorca and even brought wonderful Spanish Ensaimadas the first morning. If you are looking for a nice and quiet little cottage/finca this is your place to be. The surrounding and the mountains are beautiful. Don't expect a party area. But if you are looking for good restaurants and peace, visit Lloseta. The cottage looks exactly like on the pictures and you will find everything you need there. Thank you Tomeu!"
1048435,48733199,2016-11-27T07:32:19Z,"We had a wonderful time during our holiday at the cottage. It's situated in a very central spot at the island. Tomeu was really helpful and willing to make our stay nice and easy. He picked us up at the train station in Lloseta and we drove to the cottage. It is recommended to rent a car while your stay. But if you have one, you can get fast to a lot of spots on the island.
Tho cottage was lovely furnished and very clean. In November it was a bit cold, so we used the air condition and the fireplace.
If you are looking for a nice, very calm and quiet place, have a look for this cottage."
1048435,11284527,2016-11-19T00:04:21Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tomeu's place. He was very welcoming, his tips have been great and his cottage was ideal : confortable, spacious, and very clean! I recommend his apartment to anyone who would like to stay in Lloseta :) Loved the fireplace!"
1048435,84300667,2016-11-14T10:27:37Z,"Wir waren 1 Woche in Tomeus kleinem Steinhäuschen im November - das Wetter war erstaunlich mild und wir konnten jeden morgen in der Sonne frühstücken. Obwohl das Häuschen so klein ist, hat es uns an nichts gefehlt und wir haben uns richtig zuhause gefühlt. Ein Highlight waren die ensaimadas, die uns am Mittwoch früh in einer kleinen Holzschachtel auf der Terasse erwarteten. Das Ein- und das Auschecken war absolut unkompliziert und freundlich. Also es gibt nicht negatives zu berichten - hinfahren und ausprobieren !! :)"
901882,105509077,2017-05-09T09:08:05Z,Elly and I made a real nre friend in Antonio. Everything was simply great.
901882,5769727,2017-05-05T12:26:20Z,"Not just the best Airbnb I've stayed at, perhaps some of the loveliest people I've met. Antonio and Sammi made me feel at home in their beautiful country home, taught me to make some Sicilian dishes, and cooked some beautiful dinners. Antonio was kind enough to give me a ride to Scala dei Turchi, and Valley of the Temples is a short ride away, as is the beach. Every part of the house and yard is picturesque, and is a wonderful place to relax and recharge. Thanks for everything, Antonio! "
901882,495185,2017-04-28T08:41:28Z,"Staying at Antonio's is a wonderful experience. He is a warm and engaging person, and is highly attentive to your needs. His famous 6-8 course meals with him and other guests are a holiday experience not to be missed. The garden is a sanctuary and inside the house it is very quiet. We will be recommending a stay with Antonio to our friends. "
901882,5135038,2017-04-26T09:17:38Z,"Antonio and Sammy are great hosts, try the dinner - it's excellent!
The location is perfect to explore the island and especially the garden is nice to enjoy the coffee in the morning sun."
901882,35460246,2017-04-19T07:08:10Z,"Antonio and Samiir were great hosts, very helpful and friendly. Antonio is a very good chef, he cooked for us a yummy vegetarian meal. The house and garden are very beautiful. We had a nice stay here and I would definitely recommend to book his apartment, if you go to Sicilia "
901882,110335828,2017-04-15T07:25:36Z,"It was absolutely amazing to stay with Antonio and Samy and we recommend it to everybody! We travelled with our 1 year old son and felt at home right away. The garden is beautiful and a perfect place to hang out, the food is incredible (and always plenty ;)), we had wonderful conversations and got many wonderful recommendations for day trips around the area. Thank you, Antonio and Samy, we are looking forward to seeing you in Berlin soon! :) "
901882,7771286,2017-03-31T06:48:40Z,"Дом Антонио расположен в уютном месте на окраине Каникатти в частном секторе. Много места на парковке на территории, дом окружён красивым садом. Жизнь внутри протекает в большой кухне/гостиной с камином. Мы воспользовались предложением Антонио об ужине и не пожалели. Он и Самир приготовили и накрыли прекрасный ужин - самый вкусный из тех, что были у нас в Сицилии. Антонио - прекрасный, умный и деликатный собеседник. Да, он суперхост и я искренне РЕКОМЕНДУЮ. Михаил."
901882,80962073,2017-03-29T06:20:45Z,"We enjoyed our stay at Antonio's place in Canicatti. It was a bit difficult to find, but Antonio met us at a place nearby and lead us to his house.
Antonio and his young friend Samiir made us feel at home from the first minute, and the first evening they prepared an exciting and tastefull dinner (8 courses) of local Sicilian food and wine. 
"
901882,113618382,2017-03-27T08:09:58Z,"What a surprising and special time we had staying here!  The place is a bit hard to find, but it's a quiet oasis.  Antonio, the owner and host, is warm and hospitable and a truly wonderful cook.  We spent our time making day trips to the surrounding area -- while Canicatti is not particularly charming, it is conveniently located some great places, starting with the Valley of Temples in Agrigento -- and then returning back to share wonderful Sicilian dinners."
901882,21694798,2017-03-19T10:45:59Z,"Antonio is a great host and Samij bis perfect assistant, together they create authentic sicilian food, the whole setting within a small garden full of blossoming tree is more of a real oldfashioned family bnb with close family Connection....
Situated right in the middle of Sicily, the place itsself offers shortcut to all major culturall hotspots, such as valle  de Tiempi,, Canicatti is of minor beauty...."
901882,5206602,2017-03-01T09:07:05Z,"La grandeur réside dans la simplicité et la générosité ainsi pourrait-on parler d'Antonio ! Dire que l'on a apprécié notre séjour et la cuisine d'Antonio est un doux (URL HIDDEN) découverte était au rendez-vous à chaque détour d'un plat, d'un verre d'une question et il en eu beaucoup de chaque ... De la découverte et en même temps cette rare impression d'être en visite chez des amis tellement l'accueil de Samir et Antonio est simple et chaleureux. Au risque de mourir de gourmandise, nous avons demandé à Antonio de nous préparer le dîner à deux reprises pour le plus grand plaisir de nos papilles et juste le bonheur de partager sa cuisine qu'il donne à découvrir avec tant de générosité. En somme si vous êtes gourmands et curieux, séjourner chez Samir et Antonio, en prenant les repas en plus, est une expérience à côté de laquelle il ne faut surtout pas passer pour découvrir la Sicile en dehors des sentiers battus, comme nous aimons le faire !"
901882,21944554,2017-02-25T07:07:55Z,"Antonio was the best! Helped my parents get around, cooked incredible food - perfect stay, friendly character, wonderful food!"
901882,55894476,2017-02-20T07:15:02Z,"You don't know what hospitality means until you visit Antonio and Samir. They made us feel welcomed since the first seconds ouf our stay. The house is very beautiful and calmly located. And there are some nice destinations for daytrips which you easily reach by car. We liked Scala dei Turchi, Villa Romana del Casale and the baroque town Naro best. Coming back to Antonio's place in the evening was always like coming home. We are very happy that we were able to have dinner with Antonio and Samir on one evening. It was the best food we had during our whole time in sicily! Antonio is truly a gifted cook and has an immense knowledge about sicilian food. Eating together with them was such a pleausre and led to some interesting conversations. We will never forget this unique airbnb experience! "
901882,31660232,2017-01-02T07:25:10Z,"Passamos o ano novo na casa de Antonio e não poderia ter sido melhor! Anfitrião incrível, deu dicas preciosas de lugares maravilhosos para conhecermos em Agrigento e redondezas, sem falar na comida maravilhosa, na casa linda e cheia de personalidade e na companhia super especial do próprio Antonio e do Samir! Recomendo."
901882,25958041,2016-12-27T09:32:17Z,"You are my Italian family now! Haha I love you and Sammy and Isaac. Antonio's house is situated in the centre of sicily in an extremely beautiful country area. I recommend making the trip by bus (check the timetable as buses stop at around 6pm) because you pass all the amazing scenery and beauty of Sicily. I arrived over Christmas at an extremely busy time and felt at home right away with the boys and the cats,  being treated to amazing meals over 5 days and relaxing in the quiet and beautiful backyard! I also did a little car trip with Antonio around Canicatti and the historic city Nero as well as valley of the temples. I attended a community event where around 50 people attended and met some new & lovely people! The house is clean and beautiful, with all necessary amenities and I recommend this place as a MUST for anyone doing a road trip through Italy or desiring a prime location and people as a base! Also Sammy is multi talented so be sure to get to know him as well!! :) ciao!!!"
901882,7190765,2016-12-21T08:54:53Z,"Antonio is a marvellous host. He did everything to make my stay as pleasant as possible. Antonio is a really good cook, like a professional one... He cooked sicilian specialties you can only find in top class restaurants !
The room is pleasant too, exactly as described."
901882,4701037,2016-12-02T10:20:30Z,"Hvis du er så heldig at det er ledig hos Antonio og Samiir, så bør du booke her snarest. Jeg og kjæresten min hadde en uforglemmelig tid hjemme hos en familie det er lett å bli glad i. Du finner ikke et bedre sted enn dette for å få et lite innblikk i det sicilianske livet, samt smake på det beste av tradisjonell siciliansk mat og drikke. Husk å ta med deg god appetitt! Godt humør er også påkrevd, og noe som smitter lett ved å være i nærheten av Antonio og Samiir.

Vi kom med egen bil, og stedet fungerer som et utmerket utgangspunkt for å oppleve store deler av Sicilia. Antonio hjalp oss gledelig med tips og anbefalinger, ikke bare i nærheten av Canicatti, men også Palermo, hvor han har bodd store deler av livet sitt.

Etter flere titalls overnattinger gjennom Airbnb oppleves Antonio og Samiir som den beste og mest minneverdige Airbnb opplevelsen vår hittil. Tusen takk for oss."
901882,20029220,2016-11-24T08:37:10Z,"Ah, don't miss this place. Antonio and Sammy made us feel right at home. The house is so comfortable and we enjoyed a restful 2 nights before reluctantly moving on. Also, the meals were so wonderful with all of us dining together in the evening. "
901882,94318709,2016-11-15T09:19:12Z,Antonio is a great host and an even better cook. I never encountered service like this before. If you are i. The neighborhood this is deffinately a place stop stop and have a relaxing evening with great foed and wine!
901882,5199113,2016-10-25T07:22:41Z,"We had some fantastic days in Antonio's house. Everything was perfectly prepared. Antonio gave us excellent tipps for traveling around and we enjoyed his delicious food every single day. Antonio and Samiir were very kind and attentive hosts. 
Thanks a lot for this fine experience. I hope we will come back one day. :)

6162241,114063081,2017-05-07T07:10:40Z,"What an absolutely magical place. Diana and the extra special touches made it so welcoming and homely. We loved taking Jeffery the jack through the woodlands and saw lots of wild life..deer, rabbit, squirrels and hedgehogs too. A lovely way to get away from all the hustle and bustle of life."
6162241,119866151,2017-05-05T08:12:00Z,Everything was as stated. We greatly enjoyed the location and surrounding areas. Host was great and super helpful with any needs we had.
6162241,107027800,2017-04-30T08:50:47Z,"Wir hatten einen Kurztrip nach Schottland geplant und wollten es so authentisch wie möglich erleben. Als wir das Gatehouse zu Gesicht bekamen stellten wir kurz den Motor unseres Mietwagens ab und mussten einfach staunen. Der Anblick war einfach einmalig! Es war wirklich sehr herzlich eingerichtet, sogar ein kleiner Korb mit Köstlichkeiten stand für einen gelungenen Empfang bereit. Alle Räume waren sehr sauber. Der Kontakt verlief reibungslos und auch sonst lädt der kleine Ort und das Anwesen zum Träumen ein. Abends kann man in einen gemütlichen Pub gehen oder aber in der großen Badewanne entspannen. Sehr zu empfehlen, ein Traum!"
6162241,71684850,2017-04-24T10:55:05Z,"This is a truly magical place to stay, set in beautiful grounds. A quick walk to a picturesque village- (with a marvellous little pub that sells superb Belgian beer and great pies!)

Diana is wonderful! She's so friendly and makes you feel at home, she gave us some great recommendations for local walks and has endless knowledge of the local area.

The coastline is breathtaking and the walking routes she advised did not disappoint.

Diana made an enormous effort to welcome us, making a hamper and placing local fresh flowers throughout the gatehouse. 

All in all a wonderful break in a spectacular place!

Thankyou again Diana!"
6162241,11764725,2017-04-20T10:35:41Z,Diana was an excellent host and gave us tons of ideas for things to do. The place was lovely and exactly what we wanted for a quiet few days away. Would thoroughly recommend! 
6162241,18315928,2017-04-17T08:22:17Z,"Absolutely gorgeous fairytail property.
Lovely layout and décor and all very clean with a nice welcome hamper.
We enjoyed lovely walks, curling up in front of the fire and soaking up the surroundings. We walked to the local pub which we would really recommend as they are super friendly and had yummy pies.
Would really recommend a trip to the Gate house at Ayton. Thanks so much for a lovely time. Gemma"
6162241,77478052,2017-04-15T09:44:45Z,"Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at The Gatehouse. Extremely cosy and well equipped. The castle grounds were great fun to explore with the dogs - plenty of wildlife and lovely spring flowers.
Diana was very helpful and her recommendation of Cullen skink at St Abbs was well worth it.
Could easily have spent much longer here.........may have to come back!"
6162241,421129,2017-04-12T07:07:00Z,"Where to start? What an amazing, wonderful, beautiful, romantic and special place to stay! This mini-castle is absolutely perfect in every way. Spotlessly clean, everything you need and lots to hand 'just in case'. You really feel as though you have come to stay somewhere very special. 

The home itself is absolutely beautiful, the kitchen and bathroom are modern, clean and have everything you need. The living room is super cozy especially with the fire roaring away and the bedroom super romantic. Opening the shutters in the morning and watching deer run up the drive was a truly perfect experience.

Diana's attention to detail made my parter, my pup and I feel absolutely spoiled. Fresh flowers, treats left in the kitchen and her lovely greeting upon arrival was so lovely. 

The gate house is perfectly located to explore the many castles and beaches nearby, and closer to home the castle grounds are huge and full of places to explore. We found a secret walled garden one day and a spring hidden in the forest the next. We also sampled the local towns Indian and Chinese food which was good and worth the short drive. 

I can't recommend this wonderful place more highly and look forward to coming back very soon! Thank you Diana for such a wonderful break!"
6162241,96944137,2017-04-09T07:16:27Z,"Apart from the obvious of staying in such a fabulous building, the garden was lovely and you can also explore much of the castle grounds. Woodlands and the banks of Eye Water, we found the natural spring. All in all a very back to nature, nourishing weekend. "
6162241,96595109,2017-04-07T09:19:33Z,An amazing place in a fantastic setting 
6162241,70031662,2017-04-02T08:14:35Z,"We couldn't have asked for a more magical stay - our own castle for the weekend! Everything was perfect & we didn't want for anything. Diana was such an incredible host, giving us her local knowledge & ensuring we had everything we needed. Such a beautiful area & such a unique place to stay - we won't forget this place any time soon :)"
6162241,56081550,2017-03-28T07:06:36Z,"This was our 3rd stay at the Beautiful gatehouse and it just gets better every time. Diana is the perfect host, its always a genuine pleasure to see her. She provdes a generous welcome basket of provisions and puts lovely touches around the cottage including fresh flowers. The evenings here are magical, we heard owls every night whilst sitting by the log burner - sooo cosy! We were lucky enough to have some beautiful spring weather, so sat in the garden to have breakfast where we saw deer and partridges as well as rabbits.
This is a truly tranquil place to stay where you can just get away from it all, or visit all the great places close by - Bamburgh, Holy Island, Edinburgh to name but a few.
Thank you Diana, we'll be back soon x"
6162241,110627113,2017-03-25T10:23:09Z,Lekker Vakansie
6162241,65637611,2017-03-13T10:44:13Z,"The Ayton Gatehouse is just fantastic and far outreached our expectations.  With a tastefully modern feel kitchen and bathroom that blends beautifully into the rest of the traditional house.  The lounge has a TV, Wifi and wood burning stove with a plentiful supply of logs, the lounge then leads to spiral staircase up the tower to a large comfortable bedroom.  Diana was a fabulous host who provided us with numerous ideas of where to go whilst in the area, which are well worth taking the advice on.  Diana also supplied a welcome basket full of goodies which is greatly welcomed after a long day traveling.  There is plenty to see and do in the area and the Belgium beer bar not 5 minutes’ walk away was also a welcome surprise that both of us enjoyed. Can’t recommend enough, thanks Diana."
6162241,114946734,2017-03-09T10:17:20Z,"The gatehouse was just the most unique and special little place! We went for two nights for a quiet break without the kids and loved every second of it. There are so many beautiful places to visit nearby and then at night we relaxed with the log fire burning and a glass of wine - perfect! Thanks Diana you were the model hostess and everything we could have hoped for was taken care of, we will be back again soon!!!"
6162241,81028475,2017-03-06T09:09:13Z,Steve and I had a wonderful stay at Ayton Gatehouse. It was cosy and so well equiped. Diana was so helpful and welcoming and the people of Ayton so friendly. Would love to return.
6162241,16745267,2017-02-24T10:36:51Z,The gatehouse is absolutely lovely and an easy distance from a lot of things to do. There were loads of lovely touches to the place. Highly reccomend 
6162241,3937727,2017-02-21T11:22:39Z,"The Gatehouse really is as lovely as it looks.  We had a very relaxing couple of days - the location is great and so is the accommodation, our own miniature castle complete with spiral staircase!  Diana made us really welcome, coming to meet us when we arrived, giving us lots of recommendations and leaving us with a much appreciated welcome basket.  Would definitely recommend to others.  Thank you!"
6162241,8570178,2017-02-19T08:37:52Z,"Fantastic stay, truly lovely place and my girlfriend loved it for her 30th birthday treat. The interior is really cosy, tastefully decorated, quaint, warm (good heating!) and well equipped. The surroundings are grand with a lovely little lane leading to Ayton castle. Lindisfarne, Bamburgh Castle and Coldingham Beach were real highlights. Allanton Inn food was very good and a nice pub/inn in general, not too posh and definitely not shabby in any sense. The beer cafe (Helemvaart) was really nice too.

10 out of 10! Diana (the host) made us really welcome and is a gem!"
6162241,65022462,2017-02-17T10:32:50Z,Had a lovely time in the mini castle. Nice fire with plenty of wood and an excellent welcome basket including delicious wine. Thank you kindly.
1202709,4707754,2017-04-30T19:53:40Z,"We had a lovely time. Peter was extremely accommodating and friendly. Everything was clean and comfortable. We had a great weekend of relaxing, beer by the camp fire and hiking. We would stay again without question. A great break from the city. "
1202709,65778696,2017-04-16T15:47:24Z,"The pond house was so beautiful and we had such a memorable trip! Gayle and her husband were so nice and accommodating and we loved hanging out with Charlie. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a unique, fun and outdoorsy experience!"
1202709,35383537,2016-10-30T15:58:30Z,"Amazing place, truly meant for those who want to unplug in a beautiful and quaint environment. Couldn't have asked for a better place to spend our weekend."
1202709,82188542,2016-10-24T12:23:14Z,"The area is beautiful - very moutainous and scenic. Gayle was unavailable so Peter met us and gave us a quick tour. Luckily the weather was nice, it was cold and windy but very sunny, and we went on a great hike nearby. Everything that we needed to be comfortable was provided, such as thick warm bedding, towels in the bathroom, a fire pit to cook on, and cooking supplies. We were very warm at night sleeping. Great experience!"
1202709,87498866,2016-10-23T15:04:51Z,Our experience at the Pond House was wonderful. We didn't even have the best weather (rainy most of our time there) but it was still amazing. Perfect way to unwind and relax! Gayle was very friendly and met our every need. 
1202709,1399757,2016-10-21T00:25:22Z, Love staying there. I would let your guests know that they don't have access to a kitchen and that they need to share the fridge raider that's half size with others that might be there. Because of the secluding nature of the spot it's difficult to cook and feed a family without a kitchen. People will need to plan ahead. 
1202709,47200006,2016-10-16T14:35:00Z,"Gayle & Peter were the best hosts - kind and helpful. The pond house is an incredible getaway. Peaceful, beautiful, Comfortable, and unique. We are rebooking October of next year. The foliage was breathtaking! Thank you so much! "
1202709,40029100,2016-10-10T07:24:02Z,"We had a great weekend! It is a great place to bring a dog, I wouldn't come later than early/mid October though as it gets chilly. The town's fall festival was the weekend we came and it was a lot of fun. It's a beautiful cabin. "
1202709,55186999,2016-10-03T12:24:46Z,Had a fantastic experience at the Pondhouse. Gayle was lovely and gave us a quick tour before leaving us to enjoy the Pondhouse which really is magical. It rained our whole first day but we still had a great time. We would definitely com back again. 
1202709,7482058,2016-09-26T13:45:15Z,"We had a wonderful time at Gayle and Peter's pond house. It is such a beautiful place, even more beautiful than in the pictures. Exactly what we wanted from a weekend away from the city hustle, so calm and relaxing. We would come back any time. "
1202709,8919774,2016-09-19T04:45:04Z,"This place is fantastic!!  I have already recommended it to several friends.  It is super relaxing, laid back and peaceful.  Gayle and her husband are super welcoming and Charlie hung out with us all weekend and we loved it.  "
1202709,92448237,2016-09-13T14:17:57Z,"What an amazing escape from reality. The pond house exceeded our expectations by a long shot. Gayle and Peter couldn't have been better hosts but the real rockstar of our stay was Charlie, a truly amazing and unique dog who really made it hard for us to leave. Would definitely stay again."
1202709,5368502,2016-09-11T14:59:38Z,"Fantastic haven, peaceful tranquil and friendly! Felt right at home."
1202709,39703550,2016-09-07T10:17:32Z,"We had a wonderful and relaxing weekend in The Pondhouse.  Everything was just as expected.  Gayle was a helpful and accommodating host.  Would recommend the property, two thumbs up for anyone looking for a place to unwind and recharge. Thanks! "
1202709,21894162,2016-09-05T01:01:49Z,"Such an incredible escape! Our drive of 2.5 hours was well worth it for this beautiful pondhouse. The bedding was cozy, the area was quiet, and there were opportunities for nearby swimming and hiking. Private, easy and relaxing, we look forward to booking this location again. "
1202709,11587792,2016-08-31T02:24:45Z,Thank you!  Wonderful first time.
1202709,74327765,2016-08-29T02:01:32Z,This is my first time as an Air B&B user on my account. What an incredible experience! The pond house was something out of a dream or magazine. We had an about blast and it was dog friendly to top everything off! Definitely interested in revisiting! Thanks gayle!
1202709,16386249,2016-08-25T07:41:55Z,"The most amazing retreat. Coming from the city, the drive alone was relaxing. Pulling up to the Pond House you find yourself immersed in trees and the sweetest dog ever, Charlie, is the first to greet you. Gayle, one of the hosts, is on top of everything. She walked us through and had all our needs cover and then some. All we really needed to bring with us was our clothing and food to grill, everything else was provided.  As for the actual Pond House, the pictures do not lie; it is that beautiful. There was so much peace and calmness.The night sky was a bonus, I'm not sure I've ever seen that many stars. It was a little chilly the first night but they have an abundance of blankets available to you. The bathroom is a short walk (and theirs wifi there). The town was very cute, we spent some time driving around after. We would definitely visit again. "
1202709,31160851,2016-08-22T12:51:41Z,"Our stay at the pond house was more delightful than our anticipated expectation, which doesn't happen often and it was a much needed retreat even if only for one night. The Pondhouse is a beautiful and cozy place, especially in the rain! Thank you Gayle, Peter and Charlie for your warm hospitality.  We look forward to coming back. "
1202709,26316124,2016-08-22T01:12:41Z,Gayle did a great job making us feel welcomed right away and the Pondhouse was beautifully set up upon our arrival. The location was great and absolutely lived up to our expectations. Would certainly stay again. 
695655,78816602,2017-04-30T15:34:50Z,"Our stay at the houseboat will definitely be memorable. Our first night there while sitting on the dock, a dolphin swam right up to us and passed by three different times coming up for air about three feet from us. We also had an otter come up on the dock which was fun to watch too. The boathouse is decorated really cute and the bed was comfortable, and sheets were soft. It was really relaxing to wake up with the window right next to the bed to watch the water right outside. The waves were never disruptive but really more relaxing than anything. Everything was perfect, we really enjoyed our stay. "
695655,118881394,2017-04-21T13:38:57Z,"The view is spectacular--in the early morning the sun rising, the porpoises right in the bay in front of us and the birds flying low over the water ""fishing"".  The view of the beautiful bridge was amazing.  We should have scheduled more nights.  We did not eat out, but brought food in so we would have more time on the boat.  Justin was a wonderful host--he loves what he does, and is full of energy and fun!!"
695655,119045655,2017-04-14T14:38:01Z,"Justin greeted us personally a few minutes after we arrived. The boat was very nicely decorated and clean.  Great air conditioning and fans. The location was very close to downtown and only a 20 min. drive to Sullivan's Island public beach. The bridge view was awesome! Got to see dolphins each morning.  I especially enjoyed cooking breakfast on the boat and eating outside, but I blew a fuse which tripped the power off. Justin was there within 15 minutes to get the power back on. We enjoyed our stay so much and would love to go again. What a perfect way to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary!"
695655,9810658,2017-04-09T15:13:29Z,"We had a great time on this houseboat! It's well equipped and feels cozy, not cramped. We loved biking to town and being able to return to a scenic place on the water. Justin and Ashley are great! "
695655,46722309,2017-04-05T14:21:25Z,"We loved our stay on this beautiful boat!  A unique experience with all the amenities you need--good size shower, comfortable bed, coffee, even ice!  A highlight of our Charleston visit!"
695655,79478702,2017-04-02T15:54:59Z,"Beautiful location, awesome adventure, looking forward to booking this again."
695655,78305201,2017-03-26T14:38:36Z,"My mother, sister, and I had a great time staying on Justin's boat. We were not expecting there to be so many other house boats around us with people staying in them, but we hardly noticed them all weekend. The marina is a very small and private so we felt really safe the whole time. The boat is the perfect size for 2 people, but we still didn't feel too crowded with the three of us. I got a text message right before we showed up saying that he was doing maintenance on the boat and we wouldn't be able to check in on time, but luckily he was done in about 30 minutes so it was no big deal. Justin was in and out of the marina all weekend doing work around the dock so he was constantly available for us to ask questions. The marina is less than 2 miles from King street and the rest of downtown which was great, but getting to come back to a quiet marina was even better.  The view of the bridge from the boat was beautiful. Overall had a great time, and would definitely think about booking again. "
695655,32545872,2017-03-23T15:56:11Z,Nice place close to town 5 min Uber pickups. Clean and a really nice set up
695655,31075202,2017-03-22T15:08:50Z,The houseboat was beautiful and easy to get to. Justin made checking in super easy. I would definitely stay here again. 
695655,104357713,2017-03-19T13:34:40Z,They are so accommodating while you are staying! The views are priceless!! Thanks for the memories!!! 
695655,28821431,2017-03-15T15:12:20Z,We absolutely loved the boat! It was so convenient to downtown and also not far off the highway so you're not driving all over the place. Everything was clean and well kept. The only reason I wouldn't give this the full five stars was because it wasn't quite as private as described. There are people on the boats all around you. Overall a fantastic little getaway! 
695655,90983734,2017-03-11T16:41:40Z,"Justin and Ashley were great hosts, very attentive and personable during our almost two weeks onboard. We are sailors and used to living aboard in smaller quarters so the boat was a true pleasure for us...comfortable, cute,and a day/night on the water is better than any day/night on land.  We had a truly memorable visit to Charleston and couldn't have stayed anywhere that fit our needs better."
695655,92455337,2017-02-21T13:05:14Z,Fun unique place to stay when you are visiting Charleston. The location of the marina makes you feel like you are in own private little bay. The houseboat is very well appointed and surprisingly spacious. We will definitly be back!
695655,101089362,2017-02-20T16:17:06Z,"We had an amazing time during our stay here! We were looking for a unique alternative to a hotel and this was definitely it! Perfect for two people. We were very comfortable and had everything provided that we needed for our stay on the houseboat. It was a great option for a unique place to stay in Charleston! Peaceful, beautiful views, and close to downtown! It is beautifully decorated, spacious, clean, and very well maintained. We had an easy and relaxing stay! Would definitely recommend, and we would love to stay here again! "
695655,86043892,2017-02-13T15:13:05Z,"I booked the boathouse as a getaway for my parents.  They loved the boat and the whole experience.  They got to see Dolphins and watch the sunset and sunrise from the deck.  They found it to be neat, clean and cozy.  Plenty of towels and nice bedding.  They have lived in an RV so they were not bothered by the lack of wifi or being careful with the space heaters as some other reviewers have commented on. They had no issues. This isn't the Ritz. You are paying to stay there to have an authentic houseboat experience so keep that in mind.  They loved it and would come back again! Also the hosts were very prompt in responding to us.  Justin's partner sent very accurate detailed instructions as to getting there and using all of the facilities on the boat.  Justin also stopped by and checked in with them.  He was very welcoming!  Thank you for helping them have a great getaway Justin! "
695655,15277908,2017-02-06T14:34:50Z,Wow..wow..wow!!! The view was incredible. Nothing like waking up to dolphins and the sun rising while you lay in your bed. I needed some peace and quiet and I def got it at Justin's houseboat. I've already booked another trip for my 40th bday in June. 
695655,41939726,2017-01-29T15:25:40Z,Unique experience very convenient to downtown Charleston. Everything is as described in the listing and the checkin emails you receive from Justin answered every question you may have about the boat. Great attention to detail and clean! Thanks for letting us stay!
695655,79845421,2017-01-23T15:09:21Z,Such a fun getaway! Waking up to have coffee on the boat while watching the dolphins swim by! We will be back! 
695655,592101,2017-01-08T14:33:45Z,"We happened to be here when it was a record low temp so half of our critique is that the houseboat has no insulation and the space heaters provided didn't do enough to combat the cold. Forecast looking at sub 40? Wouldn't recommend a stay. The major negative is the smell from the septic system. The unit literally smelled like sh*!. We notified them when we arrived, and someone came out and sprayed some cleaner. She did her best but effectively said 'that is kind of normal'. So I am certainly not a houseboat expert or anything, but seems like feces is off the table as an expected and somehow additive part of the houseboat experience. Call me old fashioned I guess. Apart from it being too cold (mostly out of their control), the only issue is the septic issue. I so want to give it 5 stars because everything else was genuinely great (your nose gets used to the stank after 5-10 minutes) but obviosuly cannot :-("
695655,22572243,2016-12-31T13:19:36Z,"Great, unique place to stay in Charleston! Scenic stay on the water with a couple other boats and a great view of the bridge. I'm prone to seasickness, but had absolutely no problems on my two-night stay. It's close to some great, hip restaurants, brewpubs, and bars with pretty easy access to downtown Charleston. Justin was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. My tall (6'4"") fiance had no problems except ducking through doorways (but much taller and you'll hit your head in the bedroom, just fyi; there's plenty of headroom in the other spaces though), and I was happy as a clam (or maybe a barnacle?) with the tiny living experience. It's big enough for two people to be comfortable together while still having the compact, cozy feeling of a lovely tiny house. Expect normal marine sounds and smells - I woke up in the middle of the night to a barge passing, but it was just something I wasn't used to! Definitely the place to stay if you want some adventure and scenery in every aspect of your trip to Charleston."
260524,26180513,2017-04-30T09:11:24Z,"Francesco and Luisa's farm is absolutely perfect: the beautiful grounds, garden and vineyard to explore, the friendly dogs, the delicious homemade cheeses/wine/yogurt/jams/etc. (you will want to try them all!), the perfectly rustic guest house and picnic area for peaceful breakfasts, the fun pasta-making evening and dinner conversation -- and of course the gracious, friendly, and inspiring hosts, Francesco and Luisa. The farm is perfectly situated: peacefully remote, but still very close to many beautiful, small villages. Highly recommended for a picturesque, dream-come-true Tuscan countryside stay. "
260524,8074954,2017-04-28T09:18:21Z,"The farm is in a quiet and secluded area down a dirt road but it's a great location because it's about a five minute drive into Citra Della Piece. We had a little trouble finding it (despite their offer to meet us in town, we tried to find on our own and a local guy showed us the way - maybe you'd rather let them meet you!) The property is lovely with olive trees, grape vines, flowers and rustic beauty wherever you look. Francesco and Luisa are extremely nice and we enjoyed getting to know them, especially at the dinner they made for us for $25 euro each. Luisa made the pasta and my husband got to help her and the rest of the amazing meal was all from the bounty of the farm. Quite a rare treat! 

The room was rustic but comfortable for a country dwelling - bed was comfortable and there's a well equipped kitchen with a table. Was cool while we were there but the area outside the cabin would have been nice to enjoy if weather was warmer. Heat came at an extra charge but we didn't use it - just dressed warmly inside. 

There are sheep, chickens, friendly dogs and some cats around so fun to see the animals.

Citta Della Pieve is a small and enchanting hill town with pretty streets and lots of good restaurants. Cantina Del Saltapicchio was my favorite. For mineral pools, visit Fontaverde Terme which is also in a nice area. "
260524,25522391,2017-04-23T06:19:35Z,"Francesco and Luisa are such lovely hosts. Their farm is tucked away in the countryside which is perfect for a relaxing getaway. We did a pasta night with them both and they showed us how to make the pasta and their cheese and bread. 
It is a quick drive into town if you want restaurants and shops. 
You will not regret staying here if you're looking for a quiet vacation. "
260524,56277086,2017-04-20T09:27:48Z,"A truly beautiful home and farm in the Umbria countryside. Staying with Luisa and Francesco was one of the highlights of our trip. Their kindness and hospitality is wonderful. If you want to experience Italian life in the country, surrounded by peaceful and beautiful scenery, this is the place to go! "
260524,44443199,2017-04-16T07:08:58Z,"Staying with Francesco and Luisa was absolutely perfect! The farm that they live and work on is stunning and such a beautiful place to experience. It was a lovely place for us to enjoy our honeymoon. The location is great. 5 minute drive from Citta della Pieve and 30 min drive to Lake Trasimeno. We highly recommend visiting the lake and spending some time in the nearby towns. Really, we cannot thank Luisa and Francesco for hosting us. They are truly a wonderful couple and we are so grateful to have shared a few days with them! "
260524,5904854,2017-04-10T06:14:02Z,"Luisa and Fransesco are so nice and welcoming. Their place is a little paradise for adults and childrens. They run a very nice organic farm with chicken, sheeps, grappes and olive trees. You can buy products from there directly (juice, eggs, yogurt, cheese, marmelade, wine...). The landscape is amazing and it is very easy to reach the marvelous umbrian town like Orvieto, Montepulciano, Cortona, Perugia and others. We could have stayed there for several weeks ! "
260524,25969613,2017-04-03T09:47:20Z,"Our stay at Francesco's and Luisa's was by far one of the best parts of our trip to Italy. It was ideally situated very close to Citta Della Pieve and was such a peaceful place to be during our 2 week journey through Italy. We slept better there then at home, and enjoyed our morning coffees listening to the birds and watching their 2 dogs and cat resting in the sun. It's a quick jaunt to many places in the Umbria/Tuscany region, and I highly recommend using (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps to get to the BnB and surrounding areas. One of our most memorable experiences was having delicious food and excellent conversations with Francesco and Luisa as part of the pasta dinner. We highly recommend staying here and will do so again the next time we're in Italy!"
260524,12092902,2017-03-29T09:43:15Z,It was magnifique!!!!! Grazie Grazie Grazie! 
260524,19066531,2017-03-25T10:47:02Z,Was awesome getaway into the countryside.
260524,539965,2017-03-21T09:52:40Z,"I had an absolutely incredible and relaxing stay at Cimbolello with Francesco and Luisa. They were the kindest, most interesting hosts and the farm is breathtaking. Francesco came to get me in Citta della Pieve because I had trouble finding the place, and from then on it was smooth sailing. I went for a scenic run to town in the mornings, played with the dogs, just sat on the swing and enjoyed the peace and quiet of the farm, and best of all, had a ton of fun interacting with Francesco and Luisa, even over dinner one night! They are beautiful people who know exactly how to make you feel at home. The eggs that they provided straight from the chickens were so tasty, and I ended up buying some delicious Pecorino that Luisa makes and watched Francesco milk the sheep. What a fantastic getaway. I only got to stay two days, but I can't wait to go back for longer. It's super convenient to town, which is an amazing place to spend the day meandering through the alleyways and grabbing a great dinner at Trattoria Bruno Coppetta. Grazie a Francesco e Luisa for such a wonderful stay!"
260524,49691214,2017-03-18T10:17:07Z,"If you want a true feeling of what Italy is than this is the place, secluded among the hills, vineyards and olive trees it really is so beautiful.

Fransesco and Luisa were amazing hosts and I suggest definitely doing the Pasta course and dinner with them on one of the nights, you will be blown away by how amazing their hospitaility is :)

A must do on all Italy trips."
260524,58784628,2017-03-15T09:42:02Z,"Lovely home in a lovely town. Need to rent car as it's rather remote but surroundings are very beautiful . The nearby town is also lovely. Hosts were nice and helpful and also gave a tour of the farm. 

We had a great stay but the only thing is we were asked to pay for the gas when we checked in . Which I think was not very clearly mentioned on the description . When we checked out they told us it was 30 euros. We were there for three days and we only turned on heating at night and only for the bedroom. We were somewhat surprised by this and found the gas rather on the expensive side to be honest . But besides this everything was great about the stay. "
260524,41622272,2017-02-20T09:31:52Z,Book this place immediately. We had an amazing time relaxing and eating fantastic organic produce. It was just so nice to go back to basics and enjoy the simplicity of life. You will not meet more beautiful hosts ever. Thank you. 
260524,7850899,2016-12-19T08:27:26Z,"A wonderful stay! We stayed 6 nights with Francesco and Luisa. The place was so adorable and hosts were just wonderful! We did the tagliatelle pasta demo/dinner and it was such a treat! We also brought home several goodies from their cellar that were well worth the purchase. For directions, you can actually find this on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps under Az.Agr.Cimbollelo-Agriturismo. You need to rent a car to stay here, not possible by train. We did well with the country roads though! My only other note is to work with the wood stove rather than gas (which is more expensive than it is in the states). Overall, a wonderful stay, beautiful scenery, and wonderful hosts!"
260524,94164018,2016-12-09T09:05:55Z,"We spent a great time at Francesco and Luisa’s Farm!! 
Luisa gave us a nice welcome even though we arrived late at the afternoon. 
The house is cozy and very clean. They provide you with coffee, tea, sugar, eggs with no additional cost. The kitchen is modestly equipped so you can cook your own food.
The house is surrounded by nature,the farm is very quiet  and peaceful. Views are lovely.
We were not lucky to see the way they produce the cheese, obtain the milk or harvest the grapes, due to the season but Luisa took us for a tour and explained us everything about the farm and their way to live.
We so much enjoyed our last night with the pasta course!  We ate delicious homemade spaghetti, formaggio and bread. We tried the tasty wine and liquors elaborated at the farm and we were finally delighted with the cheese cake made by Luisa. It was a memorable night with such warm and friendly hosts, nice moment and interesting talks! Great experience.
We highly recommend this place and we hope to go back in the near future.
Thanks Luisa and Francesco!!"
260524,6884683,2016-11-23T09:35:29Z,"beautiful location, very quiet and part of nature.  Very close to town Citta Della Pieve is a great little town, very cool to walk through.  Luisa and Franchesco were wonderful hosts.  Their dogs were an added pleasure.  Although we had to cut our trip short due to a family emergency it was still an amazing trip and would highly recommend them and the place."
260524,6484493,2016-11-18T10:16:01Z,Truly special! Great spot in Umbria for driving and exploring other towns nearby. Very quiet; Francesco and Luisa are extremely kind and helpful. Don't miss the chance to share in the pasta dinner and chat with these wonderful people over dinner and wine. The products made on the farm are incredible - we took home fresh olive oil from the recent harvest. Citta della Pieve is a great town to discover. Grazie!
260524,100902032,2016-11-10T09:05:05Z,"진짜 휴식하기에
최고인거 같아요
조용하고 공기좋고 너무너무
평화로운 곳입니다"
260524,94149101,2016-11-06T08:55:25Z,"素晴らしい時間を過ごしました。美味しいワインやチーズ、タリアテッレ !!!!!
フランチェスコ夫妻との楽しい会話、私達は彼らの生活に尊敬と感謝をしています。また、必ず行きたいです。"
260524,55332547,2016-10-26T01:32:59Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Cimbolello farm and Luisa and Francesco were delightful hosts. The farm area is super quiet, which allowed us to relax and unwind for a week. We loved driving in to the local hill town (Citta Della Pieve - a 5min drive) and exploring the old buildings and narrow streets. There is not a whole lot to do around the immediate area, but with a car we were able to make this a wonderful base from which to explore other neighbouring hill towns (including Montepulciano and Montalcino) as well as some farther cities. 

Luisa and Francesco were very welcoming, and we thoroughly enjoyed our taglietelle making 'class' with Luisa and subsequent dinner with our hosts in their home. We were able to try some produce from their farm (vegetables, wine, cheese etc) and also purchased some products (jam, honey) to take home because they were all so fresh and delicious!

There was no TV in the apartment and the bedroom was a little dark, but otherwise the place had a very homely feel and we had a very pleasant and relaxing stay here. If you are looking for somewhere to relax and really soak up local Italian culture, cuisine and hospitality, I would highly recommend a stay at Cimbolello."
1012597,74151889,2016-10-22T06:45:45Z,"Die Gegend und das Ferienhaus sind so bezaubernd. Weit ab vom Touristentrubel, mitten in den Bergen mit einem wunderschönen Blick auf den Lago de Idre. "
1012597,20399984,2016-09-02T06:10:53Z,Wir haben hier ein paar tolle Tage verbracht. Anne ist eine tolle und fürsorgliche Gastgeberin. Sie hat uns bei allen uns interessierenden Themen gut beraten und war ein sehr interessanter Gesprächspartner. Ein Highlight war ihr täglich frisch zum Frühstuck zubereitetes Gebäck. Die Unterkunft ist urig und gemütlich und hat eine bezaubernde Aussicht auf den Ledrosee. Wir danken Anne und ihrer Familie für die Gastfreundschaft!
1012597,13897829,2016-08-30T07:24:17Z,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt! Das Bett ist sehr bequem und das Zimmer mit eigenem Bad wirklich schön. Wir waren überrascht, dass uns sogar ein Frühstücksbüffet angeboten wurde mit selbstgemachtem Gebäck, das sehr lecker war. Das Haus liegt nicht weit vom See entfernt, aber man braucht meistens das Auto, um die Gegend zu erkunden. Ausflugstipp: Ledrosee (sehr klares Wasser) und der Gipfel Monte Cesna in Anfo mit tollen Blick über den Idrosee. "
1012597,70735675,2016-08-25T09:14:10Z,"The best breakfast we had in years!!! The breakfast itself is worth the price!! We had a really relaxed time at Irene's place, the sight on the lake is beautiful and exactly as seen in the pictures!"
1012597,9321921,2016-08-21T06:26:58Z,"Irene's family were such fantastic hosts. I cannot recommend staying here enough - we were so welcomed and looked after for the duration, breakfast was great (and different) each morning, we got to sample home made cooking, and the location was brilliant. You need to have a car to get here, and to visit the nearby villages. It was 2.5 hours drive from Venice, Verona would be easier though. The view is stunning and the room was clean and stylish. Windows either side of this sunken wooden retreat of a room allowed for a light breeze to pass through - you aren't overlooked, it's quiet, and you have the forest just outside. This is the perfect balance of having your own space but being able to chat with Irene's family if you want to. Absolutely loved it, and will be back!"
1012597,11879052,2016-08-06T01:41:34Z,"Die Bilder stimmen zu 100% mit der Realität überein. Man fühlt sich an dem Ort sofort wohl und entspannt.
Leider konnten wir die Familie nicht kennenlernen, da sie im Urlaub war und nur Irene vor Ort war. Die Anfahrt war ziemlich schwierig, da man eine einspurige Privatstraße entlang fahren muss, ohne so recht zu wissen, welches Haus genau das Ziel ist (und in der Hoffnung, dass kein Gegenverkehr kommt)."
1012597,76771751,2016-08-03T01:59:56Z,"Very nice family. Very friendly people. Perfect surrounding and interesting house. increyible breakfast. They always took time for a little chat or our questions. We had a good time sitting together, but it was always possible to find individual time and space. It was the highlight of our summer holyday."
1012597,12077244,2016-07-29T07:47:02Z,"Nous avons passé un moment inoubliable chez Anna, la maman d'Irène.
Beaucoup d'activités à faire: marches dans les montagnes, visites de musées, repos sur la plage d'Anfo, dégustation de produits locaux, etc.
La maison est très agréable.
Anna nous a préparé des petits déjeuners très copieux et très bons.
Son accueil a été très chaleureux. La vue de la terrasse sur le lac Idro est fabuleuse. Bref, je le conseille à tout le monde!"
1012597,2636544,2016-07-13T08:54:28Z,"We loved our visit to Anfo. Excellent views, very warm and lovely hosts, unbelievably good breakfast, lots to do in the area. We can't wait to come back!!"
1012597,68851033,2016-07-01T09:00:22Z,Irene hat uns sehr nett empfangen. Die Unterkunft War super sowie das Frühstück dass jeden morgen bereit stand. Irene hat uns auch sehr gut beraten was unsere Aktivitäten anging und uns bestens mit Karten ausgestattet.  Auch die Gegend um den See ist wunderschön und idyllisch.
1012597,5321195,2016-06-27T01:14:56Z,"L'accoglienza di Irene e della zia è stata davvero piacevole. L'atmosfera della casa sul lago è perfetta per chi vuole fuggire dal caos della città e rifugiarsi in un ambiente rustico e naturale, dove il legno regna sovrano. A causa di un piccolo imprevisto tecnico abbiamo dovuto cambiare stanza, ed Irene, per farci sentire maggiormente a nostro agio, si è spostata per lasciarci tutto il piano! Purtroppo il nostro è stato un soggiorno-lampo e non abbiamo esplorato i dintorni della casa, però abbiamo potuto godere la splendida vista sul lago. Grazie ancora Irene per l'ospitalità ed i consigli! "
1012597,21586292,2015-10-04T11:22:23Z,"We loved our stay here and found the family warm and friendly. We were provided with lovely breakfasts, and lots of welcome advice on what to see in the area. The house on the lake is very rustic, but perfect. It was exceptionally clean and very comfortable. You do need to follow their specific and clear directions to find the house, as your GPS won't! Fully recommended."
1012597,24409359,2015-09-07T17:22:52Z,"Cesare und Irene haben wirklich ein gemütliches Häuschen am See. Das Schlafzimmer ist sehr urig und mit vielen kleinen Details dekoriert; auch das Wohnzimmer/Esszimmer/Kaminzimmer ist sehr schön mit einem tollen Ausblick auf den See. Zwischen 8 und 10 Uhr gibt es Frühstück, welches Cesare selbst zubereitet, jeden Tag gibt es etwas Neues: Gebäck, Pfannkuchen, Pudding, aber auch Brot, Marmelade und frisches Obst - immer sehr lecker! Wenn man Fragen hat, dann helfen beide Gastgeber gerne weiter. Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen und wir kommen bestimmt wieder."
1012597,1940884,2015-08-31T12:23:09Z,"This was a wondeful stay and we couldn't wish it be better. Irene's family is very welcoming, the house is beautiful and clean, food is fantastic and the area is just beautiful. We would recomend everyone to visit this place and stay with this nice family!"
1012597,29809651,2015-08-20T12:04:09Z,"My boyfriend and I would most definitely recommend the house on the lake, it has been an amazing airbnb experience! The room was perfectly clean and comfortable, we really enjoyed the cabin theme and the design which ran throughout the house. The location was good, close to all different types of activities, hiking in Madonna di Campaglio, kayaking in Lago di Ledro and loads more! We went with a hire car which I would definitely recommend. As for our lovely hosts, they were amazing! Unfortunately Irene was away for work when we arrived but she informed us that her mother Anna and father Cesare would be in and that as we were arriving on an Italian holiday they were having friends over. This didn't phase them as we were warmly welcomed into their home and offered food and drinks! Throughout our whole stay the family couldn't have been more perfect, offering tips on places to go with maps, water for our whole stay and the breakfast that was made every morning by Cesare was by far the best food we have eaten. Everything was so fresh and delicious, we didn't want to leave! All the doggies and cats were perfectly welcoming too and very friendly. All together this was amazing stay and one we will never forget so thank you!!! We would definitely recommend a stay even if for one night! :D"
1012597,21251726,2015-08-15T12:55:00Z,"Hospitality taken to another dimension. It is less than 5 days ago that we were there and it honestly almost hurts to see the photos of this wonderful place again and not be there... 
Everything about it is just perfect: the welcoming generosity of the hosts, the breathtaking surroundings of the place, the relaxing woody smell of the wood-breathing house, the spectacular view on the lake and the mounatins of the Adamello Brenta park in the far away distance, the family-like atmosphere created by the kindness of the hosting family (and dogs and cats) all alike. 
We stayed in the family house and therefore had the pleasure of sharing the living areas of the family, which also meant that we could smell the freshly baked bread and cakes in the oven before getting up, or receive proper italian cooking tips from the 'chef della casa' who seems to live to share his love for good food and related precious traditions from his native tarritory of Emilia Romagna. 
 
There is nothing new to say that hasn't been said in all the previous reviews. And it's all true. In one word: superb. Grateful for having spend a most wonderful 12 days here and enjoy the luxury of the best breakfast (view) ever. 

Mille grazie, Anna & famiglia! 
E ci manca la Khali...  "
1012597,4228258,2015-08-02T14:22:47Z,Irene's B&B is located overlooking a beautiful lake. The house is interestingly built and decorated. Very cosy. Communication before and on the day were perfect. There was a small hiccup with the reservation—not of anyone's fault—which Irene solved quickly and creatively. Nice tip for a restaurant just a few kilometers away. I would definitely stay there again.
1012597,14720560,2015-07-31T14:39:06Z,"Ein großes Dankeschön für die herzliche Gastfreundschaft, die gemütliche Atmosphäre, der gute Grappa und das leckere Frühstück. Wir können diese Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen!"
1012597,5397413,2015-07-28T12:56:05Z,"Wir wurden herzlich von Fabio und Anna empfangen - wir fühlten uns sofort sehr wohl - alle waren sehr freundlich.
Die Unterkunft entsprach genau der Beschreibung und man merkt, dass hier Menschen wohnen die mit Liebe zum Detail nicht nur die Gästezimmer ausgestattet haben, sondern es im ganzen Haus leben.
Das Frühstück war wunderbar und üppig.
Die Landschaft und die Umgebung sind so richtig zum Seele baumeln lassen und wenn man Lust hat, ist man schnell am Gardasee oder man legt sich an den Lago de Idro und sieht zu, wie hier viele kiten oder schwimmt einfach einfach im herrlichen See.
Kann nur sagen - immer wieder gerne - da fühlt man sich richtig wohl.
Danke für die schöne Zeit :-)"
1012597,13744173,2015-07-25T14:52:40Z,"Totally amazing place to stay. Breakfast that make a 5 star hotel look like a fool, and the most beautiful view you can imagine.
I'll be back!"
1016153,32320376,2017-05-11T01:04:28Z,"A place to hang out, have a swim in the pool, enjoy the georgous scenery, have a hort walk to the bech and eat at the tasty restaurant TekorBali which is in a 4 min walking distance.

Made was welcoming us warmly, showing us around and organzing us a driver for a trip to Tana Lot. There were a few Geckos in the room which ran away quickly when we approached them, so no cons :)"
1016153,106532641,2017-05-05T01:28:15Z,"This place has no faults, it's like a magical world. The villa is in a perfect location to the surfer beach and close to loads of cool restaurants, definitely stay here. We will surely be back!"
1016153,5247071,2017-04-30T07:53:54Z,This place is amazing!!! Just like on the pictures and Made is a great host. We will dream about this place and want to come back again! 
1016153,122714780,2017-04-22T02:37:09Z,"Stayed here for 5 days and it really is a little slice of heaven!! Loved staying here. The pool and garden are fabulous with loads of places to chill out. 
It is a short walk to the restaurants and beach in Balian and not far to shop and ATM. This place is really only if you surf or want to really chill out away from it all which we did. 
I can not recommend this place enough and made really made our stay enjoyable :) "
1016153,106458824,2017-04-07T02:28:06Z,This villa is a little piece of paradise. A tad far if you're looking to explore the more popular destinations in Bali but perfect for a few days of quiet relaxation. There is a great driver available if you're looking to go to other areas of Bali during your stay. The restaurants nearby are fantastic and at great prices. Pool is amazing for a hot day and the upstairs of the villa has stunning views and lots of comfortable space to lounge and relax. Made can also arrange massages at the villa which we HIGHLY recommend.  
1016153,675042,2017-03-29T02:08:30Z,"The place was great, and Made was a great Host. Though the listing was not quite what we thought it was going to be: It was a lot more secluded than we thought, and the interiors were not as nice as they looked in the photos. But the pool and garden were lovely. 
If you would like a super quiet, secluded place and you're into surfing, this is the place for you.  "
1016153,5605304,2017-02-15T00:50:09Z,"This is a charming place! Quiet and peaceful, far from touristic paths. Small but very cozy houses (we rented both) are kept clean every day. Made was very helpful in everything and Gusti (the driver) took us to all the places around Bali. Perfect place for rest!"
1016153,108842189,2017-01-23T03:51:48Z,Highly recommended!
1016153,23059470,2017-01-19T03:08:37Z,"Great place to relax and chill out. Beautiful garden and tranquil.
Access is a little rustic and off the beaten track but well worth the effort."
1016153,20297872,2017-01-12T02:33:24Z,Perfect stay. Made is a fantastic guy. He even took us to a beautiful local ceremony. This was an amazing experience.
1016153,92201961,2017-01-07T02:11:41Z,"Fantastic little getaway from the hustle of Seminyak and Kuta. One of the most unique accomodations in the world. Would highly recommend this to anyone! The owners, Miryam and Mario and the house keeper, Made, are all great people and very friendly and kind."
1016153,18956054,2017-01-01T03:46:24Z,"Just literally landed back in France after a 2 week stay at the treehouse and glasshouse.. It's everything and more you could ever ask for. From being met at the airport by Gusti who then acted as our chauffeur for the two weeks to being met by Made at the treehouse why we we arrived everything was seamless and perfect. We wanted a relaxing stay and that's certainly what we had. Managed 3 nights in Ubud during our stay which was great to visit buy it was lovely to get back 'home' to our paradise villa and the peace and quiet. Thank you Myriam, Made and Gusti for making our stay a memorable one. I'll certainly be passing on your details to any of our friends who show a interest in visiting Bali. Look forward to our second visit sometime."
1016153,86842800,2016-12-15T03:15:48Z,This is such a magical place. The garden is so beautiful and well looked after. We loved swimming and lazing in the very comfortable pool chairs.  The view from upstairs was gorgeous looking out to palm trees. We loved sitting on the verhandah  listening to the heavy summer rain.  
1016153,11571095,2016-12-02T00:47:26Z,"This place is awesome!!!! Made is phenomenal! He made sure we had everything we needed. We rented scooters and he had one delivered to the house, he ordered a massage for us as well as even climbed a tree and  got us a coconut. Everything was within walking distance! The food at the local restaurants was great! This place was super quiet and relaxing, definitely a surf village. I will for sure stay here when I come back to Bali. It was an amazing experience!"
1016153,5833677,2016-10-24T02:01:38Z,"We had a great week in the tree house. It is all even prettier than the pictures. All facilities are present, especially the beautiful garden with pool and super comfy bed were standing out. Made takes care of the place and helped us with arranging massages at the house, renting scooters etc. The location is close to the beach, you can see it from the veranda. It's nice and quiet, gecko and bird noises all around. Balian beach is a very nice surfing villager, no touristic things around, the way we like it. I would recommend it to anyone!"
1016153,2282315,2016-10-15T11:56:43Z, And what a paradise it is! We had a perfect relaxing stay. Made is a great guy and always there to help. Ask for the massage! 
1016153,48418474,2016-10-10T03:58:21Z,"This place was absolutely amazing. The location is very quiet but so beautiful and relaxing! There were quite a few restaurants and bars to check out (although we went to Tekor Bali everyday which I definitely recommend). The place looks exactly like the pictures, and Made cut down coconuts everyday for us to enjoy by the pool. Couldn't recommend this place enough, if you're going to Bali, you should definitely put this place on your list. Even if to stay for a few nights then head to somewhere busier like Seminyak (which is what we did)."
1016153,62952407,2016-09-25T01:31:51Z,We were met at the airport by Gusti who enthusiastically told us about the places we passed and provided us with helpful information. We were then met by Made who was gentle and kind and available throughout our stay and always asked us if there was anything we needed.
1016153,740789,2016-09-21T01:42:37Z,"You've heard of paradise - well this is it!   We were met at the airport by the Treehouse's driver, and brought to the most peaceful, relaxing, private, clean retreat you could imagine.  Made, with his awesome smile, met us and made us feel instantly at home.  He not only completely tended to all our needs, but the beautiful grounds as well - he's a keeper!  Just a 3 min. walk to the ocean side - great surfing,  and also to tasty and friendly cafes.  We had couple massages (thank you sooooo much) right at the treehouse.  Could not have asked for anything more.  Perfect place to chill out.  Loved all the artistic details in the treehouse and around the grounds."
1016153,53412853,2016-09-03T09:05:58Z,"The pictures although amazing do not do this little slice of heaven justice. It's truly beautiful. 

Made was amazing, from arranging a driver for us to climbing the coconut tree to get us fresh coconuts to drink from. 

The area is so peaceful and beautiful, eating out is reasonably priced we loved the Tekor Bali (which is the nearest) 
We ended up there for breakfast and dinner on more than one occasion. 
If you pop in say hi from Andrew and Laura (they are so friendly).

If you hire a Scooter, be warned getting it up the stone pathway is slightly hazardous, properly best to leave it at the bottom (lesson learnt).

I can't recommend this place enough, we ended up cancelling a couple of day trips we had planned to we could just enjoy this little slice of heaven."
900456,1753842,2017-05-13T17:09:41Z,We had a lovely two night stay in Bibi's yurt and had a really warm welcome from Bibi and Bruce. The Yurt is really cosy and had everything we needed for a short stay. The area is beautiful and you are only a short drive down to the coast and beaches. Bibi's farm is really gorgeous her two pups were super friendly. Thanks Bibi! 
900456,77963129,2017-05-10T15:35:28Z,Amazing experience! 
900456,25021083,2017-05-06T17:16:49Z,"Amazing place!!!! Quirky, completely chilled out with a true old school Cali feel. Thank you Bibi!!"
900456,30113984,2017-05-04T18:23:49Z,"The yurt was exactly what I expected , including BiBi's wonderful and amazing cooking. She made my experience very enjoyable.  I cannot wait until my next visit!!"
900456,30113984,2017-05-03T17:08:48Z,Awesome place to visit...
900456,77191402,2017-04-27T15:34:00Z,"Great little yurt. Secluded yet 15 mins away from food if wanted. Had a delightful dinner with Bibi, Bruce, and the two other groups on the property. 

Place is cozy, simple, and offers a nice getaway with hikes all around + rock climbing at Echo rock which was part of our trip itinerary. 

BBQ by the pool, or cook at the yurt, or join the hosts for a great meal. Costs $15 w/o tip to get to West Lake Village via Uber or lyft (mmm sushi!) 

Thanks Bibi & Bruce, we'll be back! "
900456,10392787,2017-04-21T15:52:33Z,"My husband and I had a fantastic experience here! The yurt was so surprisingly comfortable. It's really well built, you can tell a lot of time went into its planning and construction. The property is lovely and Bibi was a wonderful host. She hosted us for a fabulous dinner, she is an excellent chef (my husband is a from a region in Croatia near Italy so he is major pasta snob, he devoured her pasta bologna she and said its some of the best cuisine he's had in the States). We had such a nice experience, I'm even considering coming back with my dad for some inspiration and ideas for his farm. Lovely getaway."
900456,49906012,2017-04-20T15:24:14Z,They are great host to having us there for a night. David and I enjoyed a lot of time in yurt and dinner date there. The foods is wonderful and delicious. It's worth of our time to stay there to enjoy our date together before backpacking trip. 
900456,22600499,2017-04-16T18:12:56Z,"Unique experience with great hosts! Delicious food, great company, and lovely grounds. "
900456,119153159,2017-04-15T15:23:34Z,"Being a guest of Bibi Jordan is a privilege, few people being as intriguing and creative as she, and few places as unique as her yurt and  orchard with teepee and safari tent. And all so close to the beaches! "
900456,110515742,2017-04-12T15:50:04Z,"My sister and I enjoyed our stay on Bibi's property. We are simple people who love life's simple things - a cozy and secure sleeping space, nature in the backyard, ocean breezes, warm hospitality and stories over meals. Bibi's listing provided just that and more."
900456,7302417,2017-04-11T16:17:25Z,"Fabulous yurt! Comfortable, interesting stop on our road trip up the coast of California. Having the hot tub would have been spectacular for the chilly evening, but we still had a great night here. "
900456,42329366,2017-04-10T15:05:20Z,My husband and I loved the yurt! It was so private and peaceful. We had the pleasure of having a couple of Bibi's amazing meals at the house -- we highly recommend making arrangements for at least one. Bibi offered great advice for beautiful hikes just minutes away. A wonderful stay.
900456,57012617,2017-04-05T18:17:57Z,Bibi's place in Malibu is wonderful! Exactly as advertised - a unique stay in a really beautiful location. I would recommend this spot without hesitation.
900456,84262432,2017-04-04T16:30:16Z,"We loved our stay at Bibi's place. Everything was as pictured and described. Location was beautiful, peaceful and very close to Malibu beaches. Loved star gazing through the skylight in the yurt. Bibi is a great host. We had a lovely dinner with her and great engaging conversation."
900456,110473992,2017-04-02T15:28:32Z,"Beautiful scenery and decor, great vibes and hospitality, unique and secluded, and excellent water (which is a pretty big deal in the LA area!). "
900456,6722820,2017-03-30T18:14:41Z,"This is a great secluded location a
few miles to the coast and a relaxing spot! 

"
900456,54526511,2017-03-28T17:11:31Z,This place offered a scenic getaway up in the hills of Malibu. Great location with quick access to the beach. The accommodations were in great condition. 
900456,100451242,2017-03-26T17:14:24Z,"I had a wonderful time staying at Bibi and Bruce's yurt. It's a special place full of love, natural beauty and creativity. The property has a private access to a hiking trail that leads to a gorgeous view of the ocean and if you hike further inland, there is a wide open space of grassy fields, wild flowers and a tucked away lake. Bruce's pancakes were delicious! It's a perfect place for a short weekend getaway. "
900456,55983503,2017-03-25T17:57:00Z,This was my first time using Airbnb and it was truly an awesome experience. Bibi is a great person with an amazing spirit! She made us feel like one of the family and comfortable right away. We had dinner with her and talked about travel and our interests. The yurt was so cute and and such a different experience for my daughter and I. I definitely recommend a stay here and hope to come back soon!
489668,12437766,2017-04-29T08:48:26Z,"We hebben 2 nachtjes gelogeerd in de yurt. De plek is fantastisch! Prachtig uitzicht en veel privacy. De tent en voorzieningen zijn primitief. Geen stromend water, geen electriciteit, Koud douchen en toilet is emmer in houten huisje. 
Wij hebben genoten."
489668,10738674,2017-04-09T06:38:06Z,"Jean Luc, par le biais d'une amie, Maïté, nous a donné toutes les explications nécessaires pour profiter d'un moment de détente. 
Feu de camp, Nuit agréable dans la yourte chauffée au poêle à bois, petit déjeuner dans un magnifique paysage. C'était super! 
Nous avons apprécié notre séjour, un peu court.... Nous sommes tentés pour refaire plus long une prochaine fois! "
489668,24855812,2017-04-08T08:18:28Z,Een van de mooiste overnachtingen ooit! Fantastisch uitzicht bij het opstaan! Herinneringen zijn gemaakt met ons gezin van 5. Merci merci merci

489668,69022546,2017-04-02T09:42:33Z,"Un excellent week-end dans cette yourte au beau milieu de la nature. De quoi se couper du monde et se ressourcer même le temps d'une journée. L'endroit était bien équipé (hormis un lit et une douche), c'est une super expérience et nous le recommanderons autour de nous ! Merci pour le dépaysement :) "
489668,110402028,2017-03-26T07:51:13Z,"24h dans la yourte, c 'est court mais cela en valait la chandelle. Entouré d' un cadre montagneux magnifique, zen , calme et reposante, la yourte est agréable, chaleureuse , on a envie de poursuivre cette expérience 100% nature encore un peu."
489668,53515810,2017-03-25T08:12:22Z,Belle ambiance pour un magnifique dépaysement!!!

489668,76657821,2017-03-06T08:13:24Z,Endroit exceptionnel! La yourte est extrêmement confortable et bien équipée. L'environnement et le cadre sont exceptionnels. Enfin Jean-Luc est une personne extrêmement sympathique et accueillante. Je recommande vivement! Merci Jean-Luc!
489668,5793346,2017-03-05T09:13:33Z,Second séjour dans cette Yourte. Trois ans plus tard elle n'a rien perdu de son charme. L'endroit est toujours aussi chouette est dépaysant.  Je recommande vivement.
489668,114548920,2017-03-03T10:58:01Z,"An amazing yurt in an amazing location. We arrived mid afternoon after receiving a detailed picture of how exactly find the track. Jean Luc was waiting at the Yurt after having just lit the fire for us. 
We had a lovely couple of days and will definitely be back!
Merci "

Merci à Marlène pour son accueil et les bidons d'eau."
489668,88512568,2017-02-21T08:27:34Z,Nous avons passé de supers moments dans cet endroit merveilleux et reposant. Nous reviendrons ! 
489668,72568926,2017-02-15T07:26:49Z,"Très bon moment, très agréable et très ressourçant ! On a déjà envie d'y retourner. "
489668,114041047,2017-02-14T09:36:37Z,"Moi, 
majoittuminen jurtassa oli elämys. Luonnon rauha ja kauniit maisemat jäivät mieleen. Mukavalla porukalla jurttamajoitus on loistava ja mieleenpainuva kokemus. Hotelleihin pääsee aina, mutta takkatuli hiljaisuuden keskellä on harvinaisempaa. Yöllä hiljaisuuden rikkoi pöllön huhuilu. Isäntä oli avulias ja kohtelias. Majoitus sopii seikkailijalle, vaan ei snobille :)"
489668,108974234,2017-02-12T07:48:16Z,"Il ne faut pas hésiter à venir dès le début de l'après-midi afin de profiter du paysage et du calme du lieu. En hiver, les couvertures mises à disposition sont utiles  pour la fraicheur du petit matin. Dépaysant à souhait, une très belle expérience et en plus Jean-Luc est sympathique et arrangeant. A refaire !"
489668,18677153,2017-02-01T08:42:47Z,"Agréable séjour malgré la pluie, nous avons apprécié d'être loin de la "" civilisation"". C'est un lieux unique pour recharger les batteries. S'occuper du bois, du feu, gérer la consommation d'eau ... Prise de conscience totale sur notre mode de vie actuel. "
489668,15272880,2017-01-25T07:28:42Z,"Nous avons été accueillies par le neveu de Jean-Luc qui a été très sympa et accueillant. La yourte est magnifique et le paysage aussi. Le dépaysement et l'isolement sont au rendez-vous !

Nous avons beaucoup apprécié les livres et petits jeux de société sur place. Les lampes solaires sont très pratiques. On se prend vite au jeu de ce mode de vie : lancer le feu, préparer le lit, les toilettes sèches à l'extérieur, aller chercher des bûches, se réveiller la nuit pour recharger le poêle... tout fait partie de ce séjour atypique ! 
  
Il a fait très froid pendant notre séjour, heureusement que nous avions toutes ces couvertures à disposition (en restant au coin du feu). 
Nous en garderons un très bon souvenir et reviendrons probablement en été ! "
1483869,124598382,2017-05-11T14:59:32Z,Lovely place to stay for a short break. Initially we had a couple of teething problems that were out of the hosts hands but Jonathan was very quick to resolve these and we had a really amazing stay. Our son loved every minute and called it the magic house which it was. The area is beautiful with fantastic walks even just to the pub. Hope to stay again in the future
1483869,36343467,2017-05-07T12:25:31Z,Amazing house. Jonathan has constructed very beautiful house. It is well thought and designed. Highly recommend. 
1483869,126425642,2017-05-03T15:17:12Z,"Happy with the choice, it was exactly what we were looking for! "
1483869,55593843,2017-04-27T08:56:37Z,"Absolutely amazing place, looks just like the pictures - if not better! Highly recommend if you're looking for a quiet weekend getaway, also close to pubs & shops! Thank you for having us, we would love to come back :) Jess & Tom"
1483869,72281823,2017-04-26T10:15:23Z,Een zeer romantische en grappige plaats om een paar dagen te verblijven. Jonathan beschikt over veel creativiteit. Het huisje staat in een prachtige omgeving waar niet veel toerisme is. Omgeving is geweldig mooi en authentiek. Dichtbij de prachtige kust. Mooie plek om te wandelen en te genieten van de natuur.
1483869,42313325,2017-04-23T07:34:19Z,"Great place to stay, nice and cosy and amazing views. Highly recommended Fat Apples for breakfast and lots more."
1483869,121173559,2017-04-19T07:57:03Z,"It was a nice place to stay, would come again."
1483869,7760923,2017-04-17T08:17:48Z,Absolutely dreamy location! Make sure you walk to the five pilchards for dinner and the fat apple for breakfast! 
1483869,30299103,2017-04-14T09:56:59Z,"This place is excellent. Peaceful, restful, clean, unique. Was very impressed by whoever designed and built the structure. Great attention to detail. Would strongly recommend to anyone. "
1483869,110267054,2017-04-12T10:47:23Z,"The real thing is even better than the photos. Beautiful tranquil environment waking up to a birds tweeting outside the window. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a quiet getaway in the countryside. 

Only word of advice - you might want to reserve a table at the Five Pilchards especially during school holiday/ peak times "
1483869,66465406,2017-04-11T09:58:10Z,"Jack sparrow was the most beautiful place I've ever stayed in!! I never wanted to leave. The location is absolutely perfect, the little house has everything one could ask for. The bed is super comfy, the toilet is very clean, shower place is cute and pretty. I just can't get over how amazing this place is! I will definitely be going back"
1483869,118227053,2017-04-09T10:50:22Z,Excellent experience......
1483869,110615461,2017-04-02T07:18:00Z,Fantastic place to stay to explore the cornish coastline! Exactly what we had hoped for.
1483869,118408826,2017-03-31T07:30:25Z,Loved it! We stayed for a night with our nearly-three-year-old; she said she wanted to live there forever!!❤️
1483869,119282662,2017-03-08T11:07:36Z,"Amazing, romantic, quite, peaceful. You will not be disappointed "
1483869,96129407,2017-03-06T08:29:29Z,Loved our stay at this unique cottage. It was covered in fairy lights and decorated to meet all basic requirements as well as those extra special touches. Close to a few good food places. 
1483869,114292939,2017-02-24T11:51:03Z,Lovely little house with a great view! Very nice area with lots of lovely beaches! 
1483869,47062719,2017-02-21T08:51:10Z,My husband and I loved our time at Jack Sparrow! Jonathan was there to greet us (after we got there much later than expected!) but communication was great and the directions he sent were spot on. The Jack Sparrow was so unique and the views were beautiful! Highly recommend if you're looking for some time away and need to shut off the cell phone!
1483869,80636042,2017-02-17T08:27:40Z,We had an amazing couple of days here - really different to anywhere else we have ever stayed. There is a great view from the window and a number of walks that you can do nearby. There are also some lovely little villages close by. Highly recommended if you're after somewhere to stay that is a bit different.
1483869,108460841,2017-02-15T11:32:39Z,If your looking for a quiet peaceful getaway this is the place for you. 
2498966,60097065,2016-09-01T01:07:06Z,Cute and homely. Very basic but that's exactly what we expected - you have everything you need explained and provided and it's the perfect getaway from everyday life. 
2498966,33593109,2016-08-24T09:40:57Z,"I was looking for something out of the ordinary to treat my husband on his birthday. I couldn’t have chosen a better place!  We spent four relaxing and amazing days on this little paradise. The silence is magic, the surrounding idyllic, the perfect place to recharge ones batteries. The cabin has everything you need, every evening we enjoyed  a lovely barbecue, we had a fun time exploring the surroundings by boat. Eivind is caring and friendly host who patiently waited for us since we drove in a totally wrong direction on our arrival day, he helped us getting our luggage on to the island and checked on us later on to see if we were doing fine. I can strongly recommend a break on this heavenly island. Thanks Eivind for sharing your property with us."
2498966,11732832,2016-08-08T01:37:44Z,"Verten vår var meget hyggelig og hjelpsom. Vi var klar over at stedet var meget spartansk og vi kunne ikke forvente høy standard. Dette stedet er perfekt når været er bra. Vi hadde litt mye vind. Det var ikke fiskemuligheter fra øya, dvs det var ikke noe fisk. Vi hadde det meget bra på øya. Ved dårlig vær dvs regn er det ikke så trivelig der."
2498966,48881830,2016-08-01T07:18:47Z,"We had a great stay at Batholmen - really lovely time spent with the kids on the island. 
Having your own island and going everywhere by boat is a real novelty and one both myself and the kids thoroughly enjoyed. 

Great holiday and would recommend!"
2498966,65449734,2016-07-22T04:31:39Z,"The only problem with our stay was that is was just too short and we had to drag ourselves away from this special place. Eivind is a wonderful host and patiently guided us in from Sweden when our SatNav lost the plot. Everything we needed was to hand on this wonderful island. Our three children swam and played in the 'jungle', mutinied their father on 'Devil's rock' and giggled themselves to sleep in the eaves of the cabin.  Take time out from the rat race and have the holiday of a lifetime on this wonderful island!  Can't wait to go back for longer next time. Thanks Eivind!! "
2498966,4047653,2016-07-20T04:01:35Z,"Vi havde nogle skønne dage på Eivinds ø. Dejligt med egen båd. Hytten er super primitiv, men vi havde alt med vi behøvede.  Sengen i stuen er lige lille nok til to."
2498966,31904571,2016-07-04T02:51:57Z,Eivind is a very good host. He provided all necessary information and instructions to ensure us a very nice week at Hvaler. We had a relaxing and interesting week. I would recommend both Eivind as a host in general and his cabin at Hvaler in particular to anyone.
2498966,24220856,2016-06-18T00:17:23Z,"We were amazed by how beautiful the island and it's surroundings were. We were so lucky to have arrived just as the baby birds were hatching on the island. We visited nests and watched the eggs hatch, were visited by a swan family and their three fluffy cygnits who came really close to us! Beautiful, hot weather and even an amazing thunder storm which was our favourite day of the holiday! The boat is intuitive and we learned how to use it quickly. We were anxious at first but there was something very satisfying about mastering it and taking it to different parts of Hvaler. The cabin is so comfortable and sweet and romantic. I loved the ritual of boiling a kettle and preparing food on the little gas, camping stove. We had a great BBQ too. Thre are some local shops where we bought our groceries and you can moor the boat right by the shops. We will definitely come back to stay again as soon as we can. Eivind and his son were really kind and helpful and made the experience feel very safe. "
2498966,33110583,2016-06-13T03:05:49Z,"This was beyond my expectations.
The island and the cabin is perfect for 2. The location is easy to reach from Oslo Airport and Eivind and his son make everything as convenient as possible for their guests.
Boat rides around small islands and going to grocery shopping by boat were our favourite moments.
The barbecue is upgraded after the pictures so it is actually a lot bigger and cooler than shown.

Do not hesitate to choose this property, you will be impressed by the nature and silence. "
2498966,35591974,2016-06-11T03:37:41Z,"Eivind was really welcoming and also picked us up from Frederikstad to take us to the Island. We were surprised at the range of supplies/utensils that are in the cabin; everything you need for your stay minus food! The island the cabin is situated on is a perfect size and very quiet and the larger islands surrounding are so picturesque; we spent the holiday exploring them on foot and with the boat provided. This Airbnb listing is the complete package, as are the hosting skills of Eivind. Thank you for making our holiday memorable! "
2498966,3147680,2015-08-13T17:19:50Z,"Four fantastic days in a beautiful area, with a cozy rustic cabin and a great host. Eivind showed me the ropes and was on his way leaving me with the peace and calm I was looking for. I slept well, ate well, read well and swam as much as I could. This comes highly recommended."
2498966,29076017,2015-08-08T11:38:18Z,"Hi! We had a great time during our stay at Hvaler. They gave us a tour around the island when we first arrived, that we appreciated.
The whole island where amazing and the little house where so cute. We also took the boat to different island in the area and had the best of time during our whole visit. We also where fishing crabs!
The place where according to the pictures and the information we saw here at airbnb.
I highly recommend the place!"
2498966,17609559,2015-08-03T11:27:03Z,"Eivind is very welcoming and was very helpful getting us installed on the island. We stayed with our 3 children, and had a fantastic time!"
2498966,33031175,2015-07-23T12:19:21Z,"Eivind was very welcoming, he came to meet us from the bus and talked us through all the details. A lovely chap, he made us feel very comfortable, including driving the boat, which we were a little apprehensive of (he even taught us a new knot!)
The island and location were even better than we could imagine, a really memorable and unique experience!
The hut is really cosy and we cooked up a range of decent meals with the utensils provided... and there's a fire pit for warmer nights too!
The area generally feels safe. Lots to explore on the island, and in the wider (URL HIDDEN) boat!"
2498966,18129352,2015-07-18T12:55:37Z,"Unfortunately we had to cancel our stay at the island due to personal circumstances. We cancelled very late, on the supposed day of arrival. Eivind has been very understanding and also very helpfull. He has really thought with us about ways to go through with the holiday. Unfortunately this wasn't possible. The communication went really well, Eivind responses were always very quick. Although we haven't met Eivind in person, I do find him a great host. This because of all the (very) kind communication we have had. We do hope to visit the island some other time!"
2498966,1017784,2015-07-06T15:01:15Z,"We had some amazing time on the island. The house is the cutest and has everything that we needed. Eivind is a great host, he has thought of everything and was very hospitable. He kindly reminded us regarding weather changes and gave us bus schedule. It's an amazing feeling to be on your own island. Like The Little Prince on your own planet. Highly recommend his place for a romantic get away"
2498966,36252360,2015-07-03T14:12:43Z,"Eivind's island was the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary-the island is such a treasure! It's our best anniversary so far- definitely beats the typical spa hotel we normally end up with. We brought our baby (four months) and the bed downstairs worked perfectly as a little cot for her. Eivind and his family were lovely and welcoming, and we especially appreciated that they were available at all times. The island is close to main land, which was comforting because we didn't need to worry about bad weather. All in all- a great place to stay!"
2498966,34121879,2015-06-28T13:46:55Z,"We had a lovely stay at Eivinds island. He was most accomodating and helpful and was also flexible with check in hours. He gave us good instructions when it came to everything from the boat to where to leave our litter iåon depature.
We had a great time,and might even book for next year."
2498966,24770170,2015-06-23T15:28:25Z,"Ein wunderbarer Ort! Ein modernes Robinson-Crusoe-Erlebnis, welches Einfachheit mit purem (Lebens)-Luxus verbindet. Es ist alles da was man zum Leben benötigt auf der Insel. Den Abenteuergeist muss man jedoch selber mitbringen. Der Gastgeber war äusserst aufmerksam und zuvorkommend!"
2498966,32281156,2015-06-14T13:20:47Z,"Øya var like vakker som på bildene i annonsen! Været var på vår side, og vi koste oss i sola med grilling, fisking, dro på butikken med båten og hadde en fantastisk helg på øya til Eivind. Hytta er liten og koselig med enkle fasiliteter. Jeg var litt bekymret for maten og tok med en del hjemmefra, men det var absolutt ikke nødvendig. Matbutikken ligger bare 15-20 minutter i båt fra øya og har alt du trenger (åpen alle dager). Eivind var en super vert og møtte oss i havna og ga oss en introduksjon til øya. Han og kona var veldig enkle å kommunisere med, og var veldig fleksible med ankomst- og avreisetider. Vi angrer ikke på at vi tok sen utsjekking! Vil du oppleve norges skjærgård på sitt vakreste anbefaler vi øya til Eivind - god tur:)"
1234202,17629106,2017-05-12T08:13:08Z,"Superbe maison, Nadia est super pour le check-in, check-out. A suggérer : mettre un abri de piscine pour éviter les feuilles. A l'année prochaine !"
1234202,20058049,2017-05-06T08:40:06Z,On recommande. On a passé une semaine magnifique en famille. Nos deux garçons se sont régalés et nous aussi. Merci 
1234202,61259927,2017-04-29T06:52:15Z,"Une maison magnifique située au calme au bord de la forêt landaise et proche de la plage. Un havre de paix. Idéale pour des excursions au Pays Basque et pour des virées sur la plage ou balades en forêt. Calme, luxeuse, bien entretenue.
Parfait! "
1234202,116059552,2017-04-22T07:14:50Z,"Wow wow wow! We had a fabulous time here. The Villa was so peaceful yet places to drive to. We walked through the forest to Lebanne Ocean where we hired bikes. There's some lovely places to cycle along side the waterways and we felt safe on the cycle tracks. We drove to Bayonne which is beautiful. The villa is superb and very cosy with everything you need. Nadia was great and Agnes was very informative sending us lots of info before we arrived and messaged us while we were there to see how we were finding the villa which was lovely. The bottle of champagne in the fridge was perfect when we arrived after a long drive from England. We will definitely be back!! We ate well, drank well and slept well :-) "
1234202,6985090,2017-04-08T08:17:11Z,"A really great house in very calm and tranquil surroundings. It felt very private, even though there were houses and amenities very nearby. It was the perfect base for our family to stay at; the kids loved the forest, and the walks to the beach were wonderful."
1234202,68485269,2017-01-02T09:09:09Z,"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans cette belle villa, spacieuse et lumineuse. 
Nous voyageons avec un bébé de 14 mois et nous n'avons pas eu besoin de nous encombrer car tout est prévu sur place, lit parapluie, chaise bébé, pot, robot culinaire, poussette, matelas à langer.... 
bref nous recommandons cette maison"
1234202,20646409,2016-10-08T06:37:57Z,"Absolutely fantastic property. Very peaceful and tranquil area with the backdrop of birdsong from the surrounding woods. Very enjoyable relaxing stay with plenty of walking/cycling opportunities from the doorstep. Our two little dogs loved the walks in the woods and running on the beaches. Also close enough to take in the delights of Bayonne, Capbreton and Hossegor. Agnes was always enquiring as to how the stay was going and endeavored to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We hope to be back next year. "
1234202,14424362,2016-09-25T01:52:54Z,"We stayed at the house for 2 weeks in September. Everything was perfect and I can highly recommend for 4 to 6 persons! It is very calm place at the end of a dead end road, close to a beautiful oak wood. The pool is fantastic and and I personally enjoyed very much to cook outside at the Plancha :-)

Very warm and friendly welcome from Nadia (Property Manager) and after a short explanation we felt like at home from the first minute. 

Although not present in Labenne Agnes and Fred took very much care and were very interested in how anything goes during our stay. 

Thanks for all, this was one of our best experiences ever renting a house. 

Andy"
1234202,22788930,2016-09-11T02:09:07Z,"Beautiful house 5 minutes drive from Labenne beach. 
Nadia met us on arrival at the house and made us most welcome. The house is perfectly situated for a relaxing week at the end of a quiet culture de sac yet just a short drive from Capbreton and it's magnificent beaches."
1234202,16862119,2016-09-04T02:40:09Z,"A perfect family location. Beautiful tranquil surroundings, a great pool and wonderful living space. Everything from check-in to the local beeches to the recommended restaurants in Capbreton and beyond were just right and we loved our week courtesy of Agnès and Fred....thank you!"
1234202,28926947,2016-08-28T03:55:29Z,"La maison d'Agnès et Fred est juste la maison de vacances parfaite. Elle est envahie de lumière, meublée simplement avec goût et en plus très fonctionelle. Agnès et Fred ont pensé à tout : des notices d'utilisation des appareils menagers aux lieux à découvrir. Nous avons apprécié le calme et la forêt qui borde le jardin."
1234202,20757195,2016-08-14T00:21:04Z,"Wir haben sehr schöne und erholsame Ferien im Ferienhaus von Agnes und Fred verbracht. Das Haus ist freundlich und hell, schön eingerichtet und sehr gut ausgestattet. Das beste am Haus ist die grosszügige Terrasse mit den gemütlichen Aussensofas und Liegen, dem Swimmingpool, Grill und der schöne Garten. 
Der Kontakt mit Agnes war sehr freundlich, sie antwortet sehr schnell und hat uns für unseren Aufenthalt viele gute Tipps geben. (Fahrradverleih und Surfschule)
Wir können das Haus sehr empfehlen und kommen gerne wieder."
1234202,33650212,2016-08-07T02:40:12Z,Un vrai havre de paix. Nous y avons passé d'excellentes vacances et avons adoré la région. Merci Agnès et Fred de nous avoir fait découvrir un tel endroit.
1234202,13804369,2016-07-10T00:41:52Z,"Absolutely wonderful house and a great stay. The grounds are so beautiful and it is wonderfully quiet next to the forest.

The house is gorgeous, really comfortable bed and fantastic shower!

We had a great time cooking on the BBQ and La Planch and eating on the beautiful deck. The kitchen is very well equipped with utensils and cooking equipment. Labenne has everything you need in terms of supermarket, butcher, baker, rotisserie chicken van, fruit and veg man and the beach is lovely. There is also a huge amount to do with kids.

Capbreton and Hossegor are also both so close and very pretty with some great restaurants. We had wonderful pizzas at Little Princess in Hossegor. The beach at Capbreton was wonderfully dog friendly as well as providing free parking and some good surf. We also drove to San Sebastien for lunch!

A wonderful holiday in all.
"
1234202,12289617,2016-06-19T01:58:47Z,"We booked this house to surprise my dad for his 60th birthday, so we were 8 adults. It was excellent, it was comfortable and had plenty of space for us all. The decor and outside terrace was beautiful. Very peaceful and the garden is on the edge of the forest offers an idyllic view. 

Even in the rain we managed to enjoy the pool and walk to the beach. The local area is quiet out of season but had everything we needed. We visited Biarritz and San Sebastián both recommended day trips.

Agnes and Fred were excellent hosts and the contact leading up to the visit was always prompt and helpful. They gave us a long list of recommendations and directions for travel. Nadia, the lady that greeted us was also very helpful. 

We would certainly return and would recommend the house and hosts highly. "
1234202,1778335,2016-06-12T00:23:46Z,"Beautiful house well equipped with everything you would need! 25 minute walk to beach through forest, close to shops and short drive to nearby towns like hossegor and Biarritz. Fabulous place to stay would highly recommend!"
1234202,54081784,2016-05-29T01:03:21Z,We had a fantastic time in Labenne. The house is beautiful and very well equipped. The house is in a quiet area next to beautiful woodland and is not far from the great beach at Labenne Ocean. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the South West of France.
1234202,18390377,2016-05-22T03:30:14Z,"We had an outstanding stay. everything was well orginized and Agnes and her Family gave us good tipps for our stay. The house was cozy, clean and well equiped- definitely a place to spend great vacation. We highly recommend the cottage. "
1234202,30682703,2016-05-01T02:33:51Z,"Nous recommandons très chaudement cette très agréable villa située dans le sud des Landes. Elle est idéale pour tout à la fois s'y reposer et pour aller visiter les Landes et le pays basque. On s'y sent chez soi et Agnès et Fred l'on meublée pour que le dépaysement soit complet (ils sont par ailleurs très prévenants pour s'assurer que le confort soit optimal). La piscine est aussi un vrai plus de cette villa. Autre point fort  de la villa est l'absence de vis-avis.
La région alentour est spendide : Landes et Pays basque. Nous avons pu au cours de notre séjour visiter Bayonne, Biarritz, Saint Sébastien, Hossegor."
1234202,43561148,2016-04-24T02:09:58Z,"La maison d'Agnès et Fred est aussi belle qu'en photo!! C'est un lieux magique où l'on sait aussitôt la porte franchie que les vacances seront réussies. Toute en lumière, chaleureuse, avec de beaux espaces elle est accueillante et c'est sans parler de la terrasse-piscine  qui est une véritable invitation à la détente. Le tout dans un espace d'un calme parfait. 
Pour parfaire le tout la maison est parfaitement équipée coté cuisine, coté terrasse,  pour les enfant et bébé (poussette, lit) , et même de très bons vélos sont mis à disposition (vraiment très rare). 
Autant dire que notre famille composée de trois enfants s'y est beaucoup plue, chacun y trouvant son espace. De plus Agnès et Fred n'ont que de bonnes adresses : du marché d'Ondres et ses producteurs locaux à Steeve le prof de surf.
Tout est fait et pensé pour s'évader  et profiter au maximum des vacances. Un grand moment de plaisir.
Un grand merci à vous Agnès et Fred pour nous avoir permis de nous sentir comme chez nous dans votre maison pour cette semaine."
3389298,5607212,2017-05-07T06:12:08Z,"nous avons adoré l accueil de dory et sa tante la maisons est vraiment comme sur les photos. nous , nous sommes senti vraiment chez nous dés notre arrivée . de plus dory a la délicatesse de vous mettre a dispo pleins de choses pour la cuisine et la salle de bains sans compter sur la délicate intention lorsque nous arrivons avec des produits de sa région franchement nous conseillons aux français et aux autres cette location. merci merci a vous et a bientôt "
3389298,89958831,2017-04-29T06:33:54Z,"Dory en Danielle zijn ontzettend lieve mensen en geweldig gastvrij. Niets is hen teveel om het hun gasten naar de zin te maken.  Hun huis aan de kust overtreft alle verwachtingen. Het uitzicht over de zee vanaf het prachtige terras is betoverend mooi. U bent van alle gemakken voorzien. Van een volledig ingerichte keuken tot een wasmachine. Alles is super schoon.
Er is in de omgeving veel moois te zien. De kust is altijd dichtbij, van ruwe rotsen en onstuimige golven tot eindeloze zandstranden. Kortom, we hebben een heerlijke vakantie gehad en hopen nog eens terug te komen."
3389298,9435547,2017-04-20T08:38:22Z,accueil plus que charmant de Dory ( et de sa tante qui parle francais  ) la maison très bien équipée et surtout la magnifique terrasse avec une vue magique . situation parfaite pour explorer toute la pointe du Salento 
3389298,17630594,2017-04-17T00:54:28Z,"Fantastic house overlooking the sea. We had a great time here . There were 9 of us and there was plenty of space as we were able to sit outside on the beautiful terrace. If you went in winter it may be cramped to sit inside as there was only really seating for 4-6 people. However this is not an issue in the summer and wasn't an issue for us either.
Dory was extremely helpful - she had a friend who spoke English but we were with Italians so they spoke to Dory . They kindly organised a boat trip for us - This was excellent and a must do to see the caves and grottoes on the coast. 
All in all I would highly recommend Dorys place and I would love to go again !"
3389298,19165762,2017-04-14T01:27:26Z,"Six of us, all adults, stayed in Dory's beautiful house by the sea at Guardiola.  Dory met us in the local village and guided us to her house where she showed us around and let us settle in. The next person to arrive was Federico who told us all about the area and offered friendly suggestions for trips and visits. Nothing was too much trouble for Dory, she was very attentive without being intrusive.  The house was spotlessly clean and ready for us to move in and enjoy our holiday. The kitchen is very well equipped, the terrace is huge and with an amazing view over the Aegean Sea.  Thank you Dory for making us so welcome.  The people of the region are so friendly and this area of Puglia is beautiful. We will certainly return to Dory's house."
3389298,25909235,2017-04-03T06:30:05Z,"When I opened the Airbnb page and saw Dory's place, I booked it!  It is everything that is seen - clean, tidy, functional home with breathtaking views.  Dory does not speak english fluently, but uses email translation efficiently. She also has a friend, Federico, who is 100% reliable with recommendations, interpretation, reservations - anything.  It's best to use (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) with him.  They are an excellent team.  
For those visiting from the U.S. - lights that don't switch off are on a timer! lol, efficient europeans
***cell phone/GPS service is inconsistently available - Dory and Federico will meet you in a nearby town (probably Corsana) and lead you to her home (not on the map). It's in a beautiful, central location for visiting the area.  Puglia is not yet a common tourist destination, but will be soon. We arrived at Brindisi early and drove to see Trulli homes - Locorotondo, Alberobello, Cisterno, Ostuni and arrived at Dory's late in the evening.  We traveled up the west coast to Gallipoli one day (Lido Punta della Suina!) and the east coast (Otranto, hike to Baia dei Turchi beach, Lecce) another.  On our way to Almalfi Coast, we toured in Matera (with (EMAIL HIDDEN)  Antonio Manicure).
Bottom line - Dory's place 100% recommend with added benefit of Federico's assistance - very eager to suggest tours, boat tours, restaurants, anything!
Not sure it's allowed via Airbnb but any questions, please email me (EMAIL HIDDEN)  Ciao!"
3389298,84964994,2017-03-30T09:53:11Z,"This home was even better than the pictures!!! It was the perfect place for our large family, with plenty of room for the nine of us. Dory and her friend, Federico were the perfect hosts. Federico, who speaks fantastic English, met us as soon as we made it to town and took us straight to the home, which has one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. Dory (who also has very good English) has done such a wonderful job in decorating and making the house as close to ""home"" as possible, with everything one could possibly need. The porch overlooking the ocean is breathtaking. Definitely try to get up to see the sun rise. It's worth the early hour. I REALLY hope we can make it back in the future and I will DEFINITELY see if this home is available. It was the perfect couple of days and I really wish we could have stayed longer, but our schedule didn't allow for it. Thank you for such a wonderful, comfortable, RELAXING place to stay. "
3389298,107928292,2017-03-26T09:51:13Z,Posto tranquillo e con una vista magnifica. 
3389298,55937873,2017-03-19T08:04:13Z,"La maison de Dory est agréable et fonctionnelle! Elle se situe à quelques minutes en voiture de Tricase, jolie petite ville. 
Dory est une hôte pleine de gentillesse et de petites attentions ! Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans cet endroit. Notez que la maison est située proche d'une route mais la circulation au mois de Mars n'a pas été dérangeante du tout! "
3389298,36640914,2017-01-06T10:04:05Z,"This extremely beautiful apartment can be warmly recommended for families and friends. The three double bed bedrooms make the apartment ideal for couples and families that like to cook Italian food, enjoy great scenery and discover the local coast and towns.  A rental car is needed to get a round.  

The house was modern, clean and well functioning."
3389298,1745517,2017-01-03T07:41:02Z,"If you want an incredible view all day long you could do no better than here.  In addition, all the bedrooms and bathrooms are amazing.  Great layout with an emphasis on the outdoor terraces.  Also great kitchen and amenable host.  Highly recommend."
3389298,17804356,2017-01-01T07:51:39Z,"Super airbnb host, highly recommended! The nature will surround you and you will be in front of the sea. The Salentina house is beautiful, all is clean and perfect for your stay. Dory is super friendly and always ready to help you to discover the Salento land and the surroundings. We will absolutely come back! Thank you Dory."
3389298,73598499,2016-12-31T08:56:59Z,Dory was a lovely host and made sure we had everything we needed.   She even had a friend who spoke English that gave us tips for the area and suggested some fabulous restaurants for dinner.
3389298,3935204,2016-12-04T08:27:41Z,Sublime vue sur la mer
3389298,5205622,2016-11-27T08:13:28Z,"The house and the location are beautiful and peaceful. Especially in summer I think. The bedrooms are spacious and clean. Unfortunately the weather was bad when we were there, so we couldn't enjoy the beautiful terrace. We had bad WiFi at the house, but for a nice relaxing holiday, that's not too bad! Would definitely recommend this house to friends!"
3389298,10032584,2016-11-03T00:21:36Z,"We had a wonderful and relaxing 4 night stay at Dory's house.  The balconies and porch areas are just as beautiful as shown. Please note that the water is across the coastal highway, which does provide some noise, but did not bother us. Since we visited in late October, we did not go to the beach or in the water. The view is gorgeous! 

Dory's house is perfect for a small family as it has a total of 4 Bedrooms and 2 Bathrooms. However, we enjoyed it as a couple and loved the flexibility! We particularly appreciated the washing machine after 2 weeks of travel. (The rails of the twin beds made a perfect extended indoor drying rack!) "
3389298,8561495,2016-10-28T05:27:57Z,"A la Salentina, on vit un rêve éveillé. La maison est parfaite en tout point, je n'avais encore jamais vu une location airbnb avec une telle qualité à tous les niveaux. La maison est fidèle aux photos si ce n'est mieux car un magnifique salon d'été couvert et ouvert a été ajouté sur la terrasse. La maison est splendide décorée avec beaucoup de goût, une vue magnifique, tout ce dont on peut avoir besoin est là, logement extrêmement propre, linge de maison venu tout droit de la blanchisserie et surtout une hôte exceptionnelle. Dory n'est pas seulement une personne qui vous loue un logement, c'est une personne extrêmement impliquée, prévenante, d'une grande gentillesse, bienveillante qui fait son maximum pour que vous vous sentiez bien. C'est la classe à l'italienne ! Nous avons été accueillies au delà de ce que nous pouvions imaginer avec le sourire, la spontanéité, et l'apéritif au frais avec spécialités locales ! Ici on se sent bien, considéré, conseillé...c'est exceptionnel ! Un énorme merci à Dory ! Je recommande à 300 % cet hébergement ! "

L'accueil de Dory est parfait 
Sa tante qui parle couramment le français l'a accompagnée pour nous donner toutes les modalités et les informations sur la région "
3389298,5168912,2016-10-08T02:04:52Z,"L`appartamento è esatto come descritto sulle foto. Molto pulito con una vista spettacolare sul mare. Per raggiungere le spiagge, i supermercati o i ristoranti c`è bisogno di una macchina. Dory e la sua famiglia sono gentilissimi e ci hanno aiutato a trovare dei ristoranti buonissimi. La comunicazione era ottima. Ritorneremo volentieri."
3389298,8067748,2016-10-02T06:37:24Z,"We were made to feel very welcome by Dory. She left some little extra's in the fridge to make this welcome complete. The house was exactly as the photo's suggest, even better. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms very stylish and well though out with shower gel, soap and other little extra's. Very convenient location for us and the places we wanted to visit. We only stayed one night but will happily book again for more nights on our next visit to Salento. Grazie Dory, Arriverderci

Upon arrival, gary and jen were there to greet us.  They then left us to our own privacy.  The use of the canoe was an awesome bonus as we enjoyed a nice afternoon paddle."

975964,11691245,2017-04-27T17:32:59Z,"We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in this cute little cabin. It was perfect for our family of 3. The view was beautiful , I enjoyed looking out into the lake in the morning , sunset in the evening & stars at night. Jen & Gary were quick to answer questions & even suggested things to do around the area that made our stay even more worthwhile & memorable . They were even kind enough as to loan us their canoe which we used to row by the coast. We got a real feel for the area with our little excursions . One of the best Airbnb's yet!"
975964,64979423,2017-04-23T15:06:25Z,Wonderful cabin on the Sunshine Coast and exactly the right type of R&R my girlfriend and I have been looking for. Exactly as advertised if not better and would highly recommend to others. We'll definitely be back! 
975964,16929616,2017-04-20T16:11:59Z,Quiet and cozy getaway!
975964,119304285,2017-04-17T18:11:21Z,"Alfie is a beautiful place to stay! It wasn't so much as private, in the woods, that I thought it would be, but the neighborhood was beautiful with a little beach at the end of the street! I wish we could stay longer and spend more time canoeing and kayaking around there. Overall a wonderful stay! We only got to stay for one night, I recommend at least staying for 2 or more nights. And the VIEW! With the sun setting, it's magical. :)"
975964,60847391,2017-04-16T16:38:44Z,Such a lovely place and lovely people. We'll come back again for sure.

975964,68336680,2017-04-04T15:25:28Z,My boyfriend and I had an incredible getaway at this amazing cabin in the woods. Jen and Gary always responded quickly to any inquiries we had. We would highly recommend this       cozy cabin to anyone looking for a break from the city. Thanks for an wonderful weekend!
975964,100539719,2017-04-02T17:20:22Z,"This place is an excellent choice for those wishing to escape the bustle of the city! Nestled amongst gorgeous cedar trees, the peace and quiet of the setting make it easy to slow down and savour each moment. Gary and Jen have set everything up so well. The driving directions are accurate and checking in and out was a seamless process. I would highly recommend this spot for your next vacation! Cheers, Janina P.S. make sure to buy one of the great soaps in the bathroom, they're fabulous! "
975964,111849492,2017-03-29T17:06:27Z,"If you want a quiet get away with lots of places to hike, this is a great place to stay! We enjoyed every minute of our stay including this comfy a-frame!"
975964,28093193,2017-03-27T18:41:33Z,"Cute cabin! Every detail is perfect. Some visitors info on the fridge, bookcase full of board games and books, Mandela Andy Warhol coasters, welcome note with wifi details on a little chalk board by the door, and that bar of half-soap half-sea salt for $5. If there were a few more available, I would've bought them all. :) Finding the place wasn't hard at all and hosts sent clear instructions as they were not around when we checked in. I'll have to come back as my trip was cut short due to a family emergency. Would love to try canoeing which is available for guests during their stay. "
975964,22338863,2017-03-20T15:20:33Z,"We loved staying at the cabin in Tuwanek. The cabin is adorable, and bright and secluded enough to completely forget about life in the city. Everything was well-marked and organized, and Gary and Jen couldn't have made it easier to have a wonderful visit. We never met the cats, but we did enjoy beautiful scenery. We would definitely come back! "
975964,28377733,2017-03-12T17:19:41Z,What an adorable little cabin! We stayed here for our anniversary and absolutely loved it. 
975964,61114472,2017-02-28T19:52:15Z,"Words and pictures cannot describe how incredible this place is. This is the perfect place to enjoy with friends, family and loved ones. Alfie the A frame is a place that can be visited throughout the year. The area is peaceful and quiet, free from city noises and a fast paced environment. Snuggle up on a rainy evening with a glass of wine and Scrabble, or go for an evening canoe while watching the sunset. There are so many different adventures you can go on here. This place is truly spectacular."
975964,14101991,2017-02-26T17:32:03Z,"We had a wonderful stay in Alfie the A-Frame. We were a bit surprised at first by how many other houses and cabins surrounded the cabin, but once we settled in, the coziness and beautiful aesthetic of the space made us feel right at home and we didn't notice the other homes much at all. It was a perfect little weekend retreat from the city. Gary and Jen we wonderful to coordinate with and made  the whole process very simple. check in and out was a breeze! Thank you Gary and Jen!"
975964,112302099,2017-02-24T19:45:13Z,Adorable little cabin in the most beautiful place on the coast. We can't wait to visit again!!
975964,6694570,2017-02-22T17:22:19Z,Heaven on earth! Alfie the A-Frame is thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed and in the sweetest little town just steps away from the beach! 
975964,73840162,2017-02-16T16:27:33Z,"This stay was a gift to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and our anniversary and we had an amazing time. The cabin is better than expected. The kitchen was very well stocked, we had breakfast there every morning. Lots of parks and beaches to explore, and of course the Sechelt and surrounding areas."
975964,4422542,2017-02-14T00:42:11Z,Lovely stay in Alfie the A-Frame. Had the best sleeps in a  long time! Would recommend to anyone wanting to escape the city for a weekend.

Rui y Rosali muy amables y dedicados.
La casa está muy bonita y completa.
La paz que reina es encantadora. Un lugar alejado del ruido para descansar de verdad. 
"
3068586,16746318,2017-05-03T10:46:10Z,Rosalie & Rui we're very hospitable and helpful. The house is located in a beutiful location. Only issue we had was with the hot water in the shower which was unreliable but once fixed it's a great holiday location!
3068586,123917684,2017-04-24T07:04:09Z,"Estupendo alojamiento con una gran anfitriona , pendiente del huésped en todo momento y de los detalles de la estancia , una bonita casa que seguro merecera la pena repetir "

3068586,27426482,2017-04-06T10:51:20Z,"The cottage is lovely, smart clean and very comfortable in a wonderful setting next to a crystal clear river. Just a short walk to stunning waterfalls and within 15-20 mins can drive to the beach or inland to the mountains with lovely walks and amazing views. Fantastic for a peaceful relaxing holiday with lots of opportunities to explore nearby. Rosali helped with driving directions from the airport and met us on arrival at quite a late hour. She kindly made us feel very welcome and recommended local places to visit. 10/10!"
3068586,9467997,2017-03-20T09:47:15Z,"This is a beautiful house, in a wonderful location. Secluded, but on the outskirts of the village so that you can wave at the very friendly neighbours. Lots of amazing walks from the doorstep and a short drive from the huge Atlantic beaches. We had a perfect few days here. Rosali and Rui are great hosts, totally welcoming and have created a perfect getaway. Highly recommended.

3068586,118680948,2017-03-13T08:53:06Z,"Casa perfecta para desconectar. Sitio tranquilo, una casa muy acogedora y cerca de muchos sitios para visitar. Con unos anfitriones también encantadores! Tenemos ganas de ir en verano para probar ese río tan bonito!"
3068586,6502540,2017-01-03T09:32:27Z,We had such a nice time at Rui and Rosalie's incredibly special place. It's a great place to stay if you want to relax and feel disconnected from the rest of the world.  Very close to beautiful beaches and hikes!
3068586,17236900,2016-11-24T11:31:32Z,"This is the perfect place to rest body and soul.
It is surrounded by natural wonders, such as the crystal clear waters of the river and waterfalls nearby.

Highly recommended.
Thanks for everything!

3068586,39673841,2016-11-01T01:15:55Z,"De plek is geweldig, midden in het boerenlandschap. Rui en Rosali zijn hele fijne mensen en erg gastvrij! De plek is makkelijk en snel te bereiken vanaf de luchthaven. Kijk alleen goed uit bij het inrijden van de afrit, die is wat smal. Het landschap, bergen en de plek zijn een en al rust. Er loopt een weg vlakbij maar deze is niet druk. Vanaf het huisje kan je prachtige wandelingen en autotochten maken. Het huisje is ruim en erg fijn en precies zoals alles moet zijn voor een ontspannen verblijf."
3068586,20961216,2016-10-25T07:17:12Z,"Si queréis desconectar... este es el lugar!! 
Casita idílica en un entorno perfecto, al lado del río, integrados en la naturaleza.
Y la casa perfectamente equipada, qué edredón!!! Dormimos genial, y con muchos detalles, graciasss!!!!"
3068586,63546391,2016-10-22T01:05:55Z,"Rui and wife Rosali are fantastic, generous and communicative hosts.  Rosali greeted us with a thorough tour of the property and provided us with wonderful recommendations for markets and restaurants. Casa Rio is a beautifully designed and equipped lodging and will appeal to those who appreciate a quiet, serene, natural setting.    It is a restorative and tranquil retreat but also very close to the best that northern Portugal has to offer with easy access to beaches, towns and culture in the nearby cities of Braga and Guimares.  We also enjoyed side trips into Galician Spain from  Casa Rio.  We found our hosts to be wonderfully responsive in communicating with us and eager to assist when we needed to ship a camera accessory left by us in Alentejo at our previous lodging.   We loved the thoughtful selection of English literature, movies and music at the house.  The kitchen is very well equipped, and we especially loved the vintage coffee grinder for our morning lattes!  In sum, we would highly recommend Casa Rio and hope to return  before long. "
3068586,23540746,2016-10-06T09:49:35Z,"An absolute perfect place to stay. We only stayed 2 nights, but would come back again in a heart beat. The house is beautiful and location even better. Lovely garden to relax in the sun, everything you need to have a great time is there. The waterfalls are literally only a 20-30 minute walk away. And definitely worth the walk. You won't be disappointed. We went three times while there and swam in the amazing lagoon. All in all, one of our favourite Airbnb's ever. Thank you!!!! "
3068586,94073275,2016-10-03T09:16:58Z,"Simply a wonderful place in a fantastic area. And for those rainy days: a great collection of books, CDs and DVDs available!"
3068586,87038490,2016-10-02T10:26:46Z,Fantastische plek en een prachtig huisje! Heel smaakvol ingericht en alles is voorhanden. Bij aankomst nam de verhuurder veel tijd om wat tips te geven over de omgeving en restaurants. Wij hebben genoten!
3068586,48738782,2016-09-18T01:14:09Z,"This was a fantastic holiday. Rui and Rosali were brilliant when we arrived and made us feel at home straightaway. We even had a Kingfisher fly past when Rosali was telling us about the river. At the end of our first week the bed linen, towels etc were changed and we were thrilled to be left a lovely bunch of flowers as well. The cottage is everything you could wish for and the garden and river are stunning. Debbie and I are birdwatchers and there were over 40 species of birds in or close to the garden. There is so much to do for all tastes locally - sea & beach, mountains, villages and towns and all the local people are so friendly. We have had a really wonderful time.
Nige and Debbie "
3068586,51677827,2016-09-03T00:30:16Z,Hemos pasado unos días de descanso en la casa do rio en un entorno agradable.

10201545,115803950,2017-05-07T06:06:20Z,"Es war ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt in Wien. Sogar das Wetter hat mitgespielt, denn trotz vorhergesagten Regen, hatten wir nur Sonne. Das Apartment liegt in der Nähe von Schloss Schönbrunn in einer sehr ruhigen (und gefühlt sicheren) Wohngegend. Das macht auch den Reiz des Apartments aus, d.h. die Kombination von Großstadt und ruhigem, fast ländlichen Umfeld der Wohnung. Im Umfeld der Wohnung gibt es alles, was man so braucht: Bank, Bäcker, Supermarkt, Kirche, eine Auswahl an guten Restaurant, etc.. Mit der U-Bahnlinie 4 kommt man ins Stadtzentrum und kann alles Sehenswerte gut mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln erreichen. Es sind ein paar Minuten Fussweg zur nächsten U-Bahnstation. Das hatten wir uns etwas kürzer vorgestellt. Clara hat uns herzlich empfangen und sich als professionelle und nette Gastgeberin gezeigt. Ich glaube, zu dem coolen Apartment muss ich nicht viel sagen. Die Bilder sprechen hier für sich. Wir können es nur weiterempfehlen."
10201545,110966513,2017-05-05T06:41:18Z,"Viele Besuche in Wien führten uns bisher zu den unterschiedlichsten Unterkünften. Hotels, Pensionen u. Ferienwohnungen waren darunter. Claras traumhafte Wohnung in Hietzing übertraf alles bisher erlebte. Die perfekte Lage am Rande Wiens mit äußerst guter Anbindung an das öffentliche Verkehrsnetz und das Erholungsgebiet der Wiener, der Lainzer Tiergarten, eine große - mehr oder weniger unberührte - Waldlandschaft in fußläufiger Nähe mache Claras Wohnung zur absoluten Top-Bleibe in Wien! Jederzeit wieder!"

10201545,52288967,2017-04-28T09:34:26Z,Accommodation is excellent. More in suburbs than city centre. But only 10 minute walk to UBahn station and then 20 minutes into the centre. Good connections. Very happy to recommend. Rob & Karen.

We used a taxi to and from the airport as there was three of us, it worked out cheaper than the train. ( we booked in advanced) 
There was supermarkets and restaurants in walking distance. 
Vienna is a beautiful city with so much to see. We would definitely stay here again if we were to come again. "
10201545,50032484,2017-03-27T06:05:06Z,Hübsche Wohnung wenn auch sehr schnell aufgeheizt und etwas hellhörig. Aber traumhaft gestaltet.
10201545,51622100,2017-03-23T08:37:36Z,Favorite airbnb ever. Can't wait to be back one day! ❤️❤️❤️
10201545,244063,2017-03-21T07:05:48Z,"This was one of the most interesting and unusual places that we've ever stayed at. In addition, it was quiet, cozy and peaceful. Clara had thoughtfully provided everything we needed for a pleasant stay; we especially appreciated the moka pot and coffee, which I used every morning. Although we didn't avail ourselves of Clara's help or advice since we pretty much took care of ourselves exploring the city, I had the feeling that she was always available to provide assistance if needed. She greeted us when we arrived and showed us all the amenities of the apartment (especially the spectacular windows). The location was excellent: very close to the U station. After our stay at Clara's, I can tell that it will be one of the examples we will use to explain why we stay at Airbnbs."
10201545,10067234,2017-03-17T09:41:40Z,Tolle Wohnung!!! Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und lichtdurchflutet. Geschäfte um die Ecke und mit der U-Bahn ist man wirklich schnell in der City. Schloss Schönbrunn ist um die Ecke. Ich komme gerne wieder!
10201545,58163280,2017-03-13T08:29:54Z,Ein wirklich wunderschönes Apartment mit top Ausstattung. Die Lage ist sehr ruhig aber öffentlich recht gut sn das Zentrum angebunden. Sehr netter und unkomplizierter Kontakt. 
10201545,43910925,2017-03-12T09:12:44Z,"Nous avons passé un week end en amoureux dans ce superbe appartemment très agréable, calme et lumineux ! Clara est adorable et nous a tres bien reçu ! L'appartemment est à 10min a pied du metro pour rejoindre le centre. Je recommande vivement ! "
10201545,41018255,2017-03-11T10:16:58Z,"This is a beautiful appartment, completely uniquely designed with lovely light and spacious feel. Clara was efficient and kind. The house is about a ten minute walk from the station which takes you directly into central Vienna. It was a beautiful place to stay. "
8860800,42588321,2017-04-26T06:30:58Z,"Gabriel's place was just like the listing and he himself was excellent. Our flight was late arriving and we did not have cell service, but he was outside the building waiting for us still anyway, gave us a tour of the place, and was very responsive if/when we had questions. The location was great and the views from the rooftop were amazing! We would definitely stay there again. "
8860800,110426681,2017-04-07T06:20:19Z,Gabriel is a great host and very helpful and responsive! The flat has stunning views but unfortunately we were a bit unlucky with the heavy winds during our stay that caused some sleepless nights for us...
8860800,23104420,2017-04-02T08:44:28Z,We had an amazing time in Capetown. The appartment is very cool and very good located. Gabriel is a very good host. Always there when we had a question. We would come back every time.
8860800,763635,2017-03-23T09:39:49Z,"Such a beautiful and secluded space with unreal views. Only a short walk to a couple or great cafes and breakfast spots, and short drive to the city center. Gabriel was super responsive and checked on us often. Recommended to anyone!"
8860800,83520989,2017-03-20T04:55:46Z,It was a great stay in the apartment and Will come back next Year
8860800,70450087,2017-03-05T08:58:14Z,Place to be if you want to enjoy the sun rise!
8860800,49165019,2017-02-25T06:41:21Z,"We had an amazing stay at Gabriels apartment in capetown, it was a 15 min drive/taxi to the city centre and waterfront. The pool and roof terrace made the perfect relaxing and sunbathing spot for the hotter days and we were so close to beaches and table mountain for other day trips! Lovely, clean and modern apartment that we would highly recommend! Thanks Gabriel!"
8860800,22390577,2017-02-23T10:27:29Z,"
Amazing view"
8860800,84615272,2017-02-04T01:48:02Z,Gabriel is a great host. He was very communicative from the very get-go and was very hospitable when we arrived at his beautiful apartment. The location is perfect - 10 mins drive from pretty much everywhere we wanted to go. The apartment has two balconies with stunning views of the city. It's clean and well-stocked. It fits two people very comfortably. Beautiful place! Highly recommended. 
8860800,58529518,2017-01-31T06:29:33Z,"Wonderful apartment, in great location. Amazing roof top views of table mountain, lovely terrace and pool. Would definitely come back.  "
8860800,31150609,2017-01-30T00:58:14Z,"This apartment is all about the view, great bus link into city and beyond. Local bar and restaurants all very good, we enjoyed our stay and when next in the city will return."
8860800,6942505,2017-01-20T09:17:23Z,"This penthouse was our living highlight in Southafrica! We really enjoyed our time in the penthouse especially the view. Gabriel did everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We can really recommend to every person this penthouse who wants to have a few days in luxury. 
Thank you Gabriel. It was amazing! 
"
8860800,60532252,2017-01-17T07:00:33Z,We were made to feel very welcome and spoilt with the stunning apartment and views of table mountain and the city. Very romantic and idyllic. Wish we had more time to make full use of the amazing pool and braai area. Gabriel and Bev were very welcoming and happy to answer all my questions before and during our holiday. We will be sure to stay again.
8860800,75010863,2017-01-12T03:16:52Z,"Great apartment with stunning views.  Good value,
very easy to reach central locations by public transport.  Nice area with nearby shops. "
8860800,29603706,2017-01-09T02:23:15Z,"For a weekend it's ok. The doors rattled all night so we were kept awake as the catch was broken. When we emailed Gabriel he said he was aware of the broken catch a d broken shelf. The air con had not been serviced so that could not be used while we sleep as it had a noise and could only blow freezing air. As there are no black out blinds we were awake at 5.30am as that's sunrise.
We found no manual so loads of things like getting into the grounds other than with a car was not clear.
Although it says free Wifi, the sign in the apartment tells you that the package bought is only to check emails etc, no streaming, no downloading etc.
We felt that as Gabriel said he had to be out of town even when he returned could not pop round and intoduce himself although we were there 9 days.
Just never felt relaxed as we also had something that we had to worry about before bed. 
Great views and I think this is their selling point and no other effort has gone into the apartment. 
"
8860800,26365767,2016-12-31T08:00:00Z,We could not have stayed at a better place for a visit in Cape Town. The apartment is located perfectly in a nice calm neighborhood. Gabriel was a super friendly and very helpful host who always responded immediately if we had any questions during our stay. The pictures are accurate and you definitely can't beat this awesome view over CT :)
8860800,8321088,2016-12-26T06:36:41Z,"The place is gorgeous. Gabriel was great. If you want to treat yourself, stay here. You won't be disappointed!!"
8860800,96238995,2016-12-21T09:36:51Z,"Gabriel's place is immaculate. One of the prettiest views of the city I've ever seen with a great pool deck and bedroom vista. We highly recommend his apartment to anyone looking for a prime, safe and beautiful Cape Town experience. "
8860800,30960450,2016-12-17T00:28:00Z,"Great neighbourhood and exceptional views; the rooftop pool area is incredible and absolutely fantastic for hanging out on on hot days. 
You can watch the cable cars go up and down table mountain, and see the afternoon clouds rolling over, absolutely stunning. 

Felt very safe, great area and close to some excellent restaurants etc. "
8860800,102343250,2016-12-13T07:48:21Z,Words can't describe the views from this very special penthouse apartment. Worth every penny. A wonderful start to our holiday in South Africa.
1830012,95481281,2017-05-06T07:00:49Z,"I can't speak highly enough of Raimundo's place. It was absolutely picturesque, and we were within walking distance of public transit, tour stops, food and more. The room itself was beautifully decorated, and we were beyond comfortable. Definitely consider staying here during your time in Barcelona!"
1830012,86422050,2017-05-01T07:21:07Z,"Excelente lugar muy bien ubicado y a pesar de no estar raimundo , Montserrat fue muy buena anfitriona todo muy bonito igual como sale en las fotos . 
El único tema sería lo de las escaleras , por si llevan maletas pesadas y que nos faltó algo pasa secar la vajilla"
1830012,37163582,2017-04-28T07:24:24Z,"This place is incredible. It's in the perfect location, set amidst the laneways of (in my opinion) the best neighborhood in Barcelona. The apartment is spectacular - exquisitely clean and with great light and air flow and a very comfy bed. Raimundo gave a wonderful overview during check-in and shared local recommendations to make our stay even easier. This is an A+++++++ and very special place! Can't wait to come back!"
1830012,30241393,2017-04-17T06:42:30Z,"Raimundo is a great host.  He gave us the warmest of welcomes and couldn't have been more helpful in terms of explaining everything the apartment and giving us lots of information about the locality.  As a studio apartment it is perfect for two people.  In excellent condition with very attractive decor.  Great location.  As Raimundo points out in his details, the apartment is on the 4th floor with no elevator which didn't bother us.  We would definitely stay there again if we returned to Barcelona.  "
1830012,87697120,2017-04-15T00:53:05Z,"This was my first time booking with AirBnB and as a woman travelling alone with my 2 daughters naturally I was a little nervous about being greeted in an apartment by a man I did not know. However the minute we met Raimundo he immediately made me feel completely at ease and was a fabulous host. He spent time showing us the points of interest on a map and giving us tips of how to get there. Raimundo was very helpful and informative offering us recommendations for restaurants, supermarkets and fun activities to do with the kids. The apartment felt very safe, it was exactly as it looks on the pictures, and was immaculately clean. I will definitely return."
1830012,91575490,2017-04-07T06:26:38Z,The flat is perfect. It is exactly as advertised and that means pretty darned great. It's located about 10 min from the Aerobus station at Plaça de Cataluyan (excuse any spelling errors) in a lovely winding street. I'll admit the walk-up can be a bit much with luggage but once you're there and settled it's a dream. And everything is so close fr
1830012,46183163,2017-03-26T09:10:09Z,"Raimundo's place exceeded our expectations in so many ways. The apartment was incredibly clean, with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  The location is great - right in the heart of the city. Raimundo is such a helpful and accommodating host! He went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable. Very highly recommended!"
1830012,27504662,2017-03-19T07:45:52Z,"Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said. Raimundo is an AMAZING host. The apartment was great and is in an EXCELLENT location. Sure you have to climb a few flights of stairs to get there but it's well worth it and expected in Europe. Plus it's a great way to burn some extra calories after eating all the FANTASTIC food Barcelona has to offer. The apartment was clean and exactly what we expected based on the pictures and the other reviews. The apartment has Wi-Fi which is more or less necessary when traveling to other countries. The shower has great water pressure, although at times it left my wife without hot water but that's mainly due to the fact that I would take such long showers before her. The french windows were a plus and the Nespresso Machine made me feel right at home. My wife and I would definitely stay at Raimundo's place again if we ever make it back to Barcelona which I hope we do. Cheers!"
1830012,8265228,2017-03-11T09:25:10Z,"Raimundo's place is absolutely lovely and in an ideal location, right next to the best coffee spot in Barca and one of the best restaurants as well renowned for its Sangria! The apartment is well decorated with everything you need to cook and be comfortable and the WIFI is fast. Raimundo is an amazing host, flexible and friendly with excellent communication skills! Will try to stay again soon :)"
1830012,28050503,2017-02-23T10:56:46Z,"We loved everything about staying in Raimundo's romantic apartment in barri gothic.  It was as advertised and more!  The bed is heavenly. The neighborhood quiet and quaint, walkable, close to transit and anything we wanted to do.  Raimundo is the perfect host.  Friendly, welcoming and helpful.  His recommendations proved to be most enchanting.  We got around Barcelona quite well and felt at home in the charming apartment. The pictures are actual.  It's small and cozy but absolutely comfortable, with a nice bathroom and shower, lots of natural light, two balconies, equipped with whatever we needed and Raimundo had also provided a few things for the morning to us us started. A bit of warning:  4 flights of stairs will keep you in shape! You'll love Barcelona and especially if you stay here as a guest of Raimundo."
1830012,3725048,2017-02-15T08:57:25Z,"Raimundos apartment is in the most perfect location in Barcelona, its in the heart of the Born district which makes you feel immediately like a local. The stairs are a welcome exercise, to eating and enjoying tapas on vacation, and the space is perfect for a couple on a long stay. The apartment itself is centrally located but very quiet at night and perfect for a good nights sleep. The bed is very comfortable, which is hard to find on AirBnB's and the kitchen was perfect for all our needs to cook in the nights and mornings we chose to. Raimundo was the ultimate host, making checkin a breeze and offering dozens of recommendations for local eats and things to do that other tour sites may not list, seeing the city as a local which me and my husband love. The bathroom had a slight smell at times, due to the sewer system in the neighborhood, but we shut the door and this seemed to take care of the problem, we told Raimundo and he is looking into it. The shower pressure is amazing and the light and space in both the living area and bathroom were perfect. The Wifi is very fast and we had everything we needed right outside our doors, for the perfect exploration of Barcelona. "
1830012,38606851,2017-02-10T08:36:31Z,"This was my second time coming to Barcelona and the experience was so much better staying in this neighborhood. I highly recommend this space for it is in a walking distance to most attractions in the city, truly a perfect location. The apartment is beautiful, made me wish it was mine which for a few days it felt like it was. Raimundo is an amazing host with tons of recommendations and the upmost attention. Defiantly if I come back to this city I'll be staying here again!  "
1830012,90745986,2017-02-08T10:09:56Z,"Netter Gastgeber.
Tolle Lage
Top Unterkunft
Sehr zu empfehlen"
1830012,13105291,2017-01-29T07:38:32Z,"Raimundo was the perfect host, very thorough with explaining everything and telling us everything in the neighborhood. Apartment was very airy and clean. The apartment looks just like the photos! I had no complaints and would love to stay here again. "
1830012,97929875,2017-01-19T08:30:12Z,"Raimundo is very kind and is perfectly considerate of staying relaxed while staying in an apartment. I was impressed because there were fruit, coffee, water, milk, and bread. 
The location is also very good.
Everywhere was clean and comfortable.
I'd really like to recommend it.
9일간 머물렀던 한국인부부입니다. 호스트가 매우 친절하고 매너있어요. 이런저런 소소한 팁들을 알려줬어요. 아파트도 예쁘고 간식거리들도 있어서 좋았어요."
1830012,10541501,2017-01-11T09:55:11Z,Raimundo is a great host that makes you feel totally taken care of.  We had an early morning flight and he helped arrange a taxi for us.  He also helped us with some VAT tax return items.  His place is beautiful and his hosting takes this place to the next level!
1830012,16128614,2017-01-06T08:10:30Z,"Excellent place to stay, terrific host. I recommend to everyone! "
1830012,70664930,2016-12-29T08:09:47Z,"Una casa preciosa, con toda clase de detalles, limpia y cómoda. La ubicación inmejorable. Si vais en coche hay un parque a menos de 300 m. Una cosa importante es, que no tiene ascensor, lo digo por si os volvéis locos haciendo maletas como nosotras :0( 
Raimundo simplemente genial. Gracias por todo. "
1830012,2787154,2016-12-27T10:27:49Z,"An ideal location in the heart of Barcelona. Are there stairs? Yes. Oh well.

Tessa made sure that our every question was answered with her little notes. If you are an artist, you will find her place truly inspiring. If not, you will just find it truly cozy. "
388767,97480588,2016-12-22T11:57:16Z,It's really nice and special!
388767,6930995,2016-12-11T09:33:43Z,"Tessas Wohnung ist sehr gemütlich, sodass man sich direkt zuhause fühlt. Tessa habe ich nicht getroffen, da sie selbst gerade auf Reisen ist, aber sie hat sich im Vorfeld wunderbar gekümmert und wertvolle Tipps gegeben. Bei meiner Ankunft war ihr Co-Host Gys da, um mir alles zu zeigen. Vielen lieben Dank euch beiden!"
388767,73704927,2016-12-07T08:56:16Z,"It's so woderful house. Very clean and specially decorated. Thoughtfully, host has arranged all kind of amenaties. Quiet and clean arond the house, Camden town, and can get reach places like Victoria st. or Oxford Circus bery easily by taking the bus, C2."

388767,98304260,2016-11-26T10:56:10Z,"You have to live here when you come to London haha! I just can't love Tessa's house more. It's so vintage and edgy and I think that's what I think London should be like. Tessa is so nice and helpful and has everything you need to make the trip perfect. Although it's sad that Tessa won't do airbnb for full time next year, I highly recommend you to live here when it's available!"
388767,84699246,2016-11-24T08:04:25Z,"Really fantastic house in England. Tessa is such a lovely host. She has every perfect detail in her house, which is really an art itself.

388767,52968426,2016-10-16T09:18:41Z,"We were met by Tessa's co host Gys, who showed us absolutely everything we needed to know.  Tessa was away, but by the end of our stay, we almost felt we knew her, through her helpful hints.  Her home is stunning, like a mini museum, with beautiful objects everywhere we looked.
Tessa provided a huge amount of useful information about the neighborhood and London.  Her top ten tips were great!
We were in the UK at the start of a three and a half week tour--we are taking our seven year old on a Children's Book adventure.  Tessa's was close to everything--he saw the real sites for Harry Potter, Winnie the Pooh, Paddington, 101 Dalmations, Mary Poppins, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, Narnia, the Hobbit, E. Nesbit, Roald Dahl, Noel Streatfeild and more!  After running around all day, it was heavenly to come back to Tessa's and relax.  It truly felt like home.  We slept great in the sofa bed, and my son loved the air bed! I would recommend Tessa's to anyone.  It is especially well suited for families.
We were all sorry to have to move on.  Thank you Tessa for everything!  We hope to visit again, and maybe meet you next time. "

It's an ideal home and you can't find a better host than Tessa on Airbnb, which makes everything more wonderful. Tessa give us so many useful suggestions about those best of the best places which you can't find on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN).
So much memories, so much fun and we really enjoy our time living here.
I will still choose this place to live when next time to London!"

3849435,106440295,2017-04-17T16:41:55Z,Local como descrito no site. Apartamento impecável e ótimo para relaxar. O proprietário é flexível da maneira que pode em relação a check in e chek out. Não tive uma vírgula de problemas. 
3849435,78467448,2017-04-12T12:18:04Z,"O apartamento é muito bom e muito bem localizado. A área é relativamente ampla, com grande e arejada sacada. Cama e travesseiro confortáveis. Isso sem contar o quão atencioso foi o anfitrião Alexandre. Vimos muito policiamento na área, o que nos deixou seguros. Há variedade de pontos pra turismo, bares, restaurantes, farmácias e o supermercado quase em frente, que facilitaram bastante a estadia. Próximo ao metrô de São Bento e locais históricos. Da pra fazer bastante coisa a pé mesmo. Passeio legal com o projeto Bike Tour SP, em que você conhece pontos de SP pedalando. Eles pedem apenas 2kg de alimento não perecível. Pra quem como nós está indo para ""turistar"", vale a pena conferir."
3849435,38198130,2017-04-04T11:58:56Z,"Estou tendo o prazer de poder utilizar alguns dos apartamentos apresentados pelo Alexandre e a Fabiana, e vem sendo uma ótima experiência e esta foi mais uma super recomendo.

Para aqueles que querem ter uma grande experiência pelo airbnb optem por um dos apartamentos apresentados por eles e não vão se arrepender."

3849435,96793657,2017-03-12T14:20:21Z,"Apartamento super limpo e bem organizado, fica bem no Centro de SP, próximo à Rua 25 de Março. Tem porteiro 24 horas e policiamento próximo. Muito bom! Alexandre foi atencioso, explicando todos os detalhes desde o momento da reserva. :)"
3849435,3830021,2017-03-10T14:31:01Z,"Alexandre is a great host. The flat was clean and very cozy in a vintage style. The view from the balcony is amazing typical from São Paulo city, lots of interesting buildings around and some green area. During the night, the sound of the City doesn't disturb at all. I truly recommend this place in the heart of São Paulo. "
3849435,103535870,2017-03-03T14:48:44Z,"A hospedagem foi ótima, tudo conforme combinado e visto nas fotos. Localizado bem no centro de SP e durante o dia dá pra ir a pé a vários locais interessantes como a Pinacoteca, Mosteiro de São Bento, Estação da Luz, Mercado Municipal e Rua 25 de março. Agradecemos a Alexandre pela hospitalidade."
3849435,100185110,2017-02-23T13:48:27Z,Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit in São Paulo. Alexandre war immer erreichbar bei Fragen. Das Appartement ist im Zentrum der Stadt und sehr schön eingerichtet. Wir hatten alles was man braucht und haben uns auf Grund der guten Kommunikation und schönen Umgebung immer wohl gefühlt.
3849435,89742004,2017-02-17T13:30:48Z,"Apartamento muito bem decorado, ambiente agradável e bem localizado pra quem vai circular pelos principais pontos turísticos de são Paulo. Foi minha segunda experiência com Airbnb e diferente da primeira experiência o anfitrião tem um anúncio claro e bem explicado. O Alexandre foi rápido em responder minhas dúvidas e fez com que sentisse confiança na locação No dia do check in foi até o apartamento nos dar boas vindas e certificar-se de que estava tudo 100%. Excelente anfitrião, recomendo."
3849435,84988459,2017-01-22T13:20:30Z,"O apartamento do Alexandre é muito bem localizado e exatamente como nas fotos. Comporta muito bem 4 pessoas e ficamos bastante confortáveis. Não tem vaga na garagem, mas tem um estacionamento super seguro do lado que aceita diária. Farmácias, bancos e comércio no entorno, além da rua ser bastante segura. Gostamos muito! Voltaremos mais vezes. "
3849435,24447796,2017-01-09T10:13:00Z,"Foi muito boa nossa recepção. O Alexandre é muito atencioso e sempre que precisamos ele nos auxiliou, inclusive quando um dos hospedes adoeceu e ele nos indicou, e nos orientou o melhor hospital e mais proximo para irmos. O local é muito, mais muuito central mesmo. Quaze esquina da Rua Sta Ifigenia (otima para comprar de eletrônicos). Nota 10!"
3849435,108024419,2016-12-23T12:28:45Z,"Atendimento cordial e rápido pois conseguimos efetuar a reserva em apenas 6 hrs de antecedência. Localização privilegiada para nosso objetivo (visitar o centro SP e suas atrações populares). Ambiente limpo, organizado e estacionamento pago mas ao lado do local, inclusive com supermercado, em frente do imóvel.

Como primeira experiência, com a AIRBNB, indico!"
3849435,98812149,2016-12-21T12:13:33Z,Adorei o apartamento! Apesar da agitação do centro é muito confortável! 
3849435,105944973,2016-12-17T13:21:14Z,ótima localização!
3849435,21960337,2016-12-13T13:41:58Z,"Alexandre é um excelente anfitrião, sempre solícito e gentil. O apartamento é como está descrito. A região é bem localizada onde fica o ap. Ficamos eu e minha família por 6 dias, alugamos mais 2 apartamentos no mesmo prédio que pertencem ao Alexandre e todos adoraram. Obrigada Alexandre"
3849435,68855634,2016-12-05T10:23:14Z,Apartamento aconchegante e confortável. Local de acesso ao metrô excelente perto da zona de comércio. Muito bom

2791283,1681789,2017-05-14T09:52:44Z,"Perast is a lovely little town set on the Bay of Kotor. The apartment is cozy and convenient for exploring the area. 

Nela decorated the apartment with family artifacts and the stone patio is nop notch. For those who plan to cook in, be prepared to be resourceful. The bathroom is down a narrow spiral case stairway. 

Sit on the patio and watch the hustle and bustle of tourists, boats and cars from 8 am - 5 pm. Quite busy during the day and quiet during the mornings and evenings. Enjoy the view of the islands and the entire scenery of the bay. Lots of places to eat, Dardin was our favorite. If you're lucky, you'll hear live music floating across the water. 
"
2791283,49103146,2017-05-11T07:49:15Z,"Nela's apartment is a great place to stay. Breathtaking view and location, the balcon where you can eat, rest and tan in a beatiful scenery around you. 
Perast in one of the most beautifil places in Kotors Bay. Really. 
And in the neighbourhood you have one of the best restaurants in whole Montenegro - CONTE ( Perast) and Galion ( Kotor). 
Contact with Nela was great, there was no problem with check-in and check-out. 
I really recommend this place to all of you!"
2791283,114513396,2017-05-04T06:07:09Z,"The balcony is definitely the best in Perast - a great panoramic view and very private for breakfasts and dinners.  The apartment has everything we needed, plus history.  When the tour groups leave, the town returns to peace and tranquillity.  We loved the whole experience. Parking the car by the apartment was easy.   If you're driving from Kotor it's easier to take the second turning into Perast to avoid the narrow street.   There's a convenience store nearby and restaurants a stroll away where we found locals outnumber tourists.   Thanks Neela"
2791283,39727991,2017-04-24T14:49:01Z,Amazing Location!
2791283,1999195,2017-04-17T06:52:22Z,Communication with Nela was easy and she provided lots of tips and facts about the area.  The terrace and view are amazing.  The location is great but is best accessed using a car.  Lots of tourists so can get quite busy with people and traffic.  Nearly all the restaurants in Perast have outdoor eating and drinking areas and you can easily spend a few hours admiring the view.
2791283,33254324,2017-04-13T06:50:31Z,"Book it now. Don't hesitate. We didn't go any further than the picture of the terrace before we decided that this would be where we spent 4 nights and 5 days. Nela is wonderful (over text) and her property manager is nice. The value for this view is unreal. You do get a lot of foot traffic, small buses, and taxi boats right outside your front door, but it all melts away after sunset. And truly, the people are nice enough and the tourists enamored enough to make it not something you'll mind during your stay. My only complaint was the smell in the bathroom. Even the feral (but sweet) cats around didn't perturb me as much I thought thy would (I am allergic). The bed is fairly comfortable and big. The kitchen is well-equipped and has an INCREDIBLE view of its own out the window. But it's the terrace (I know everyone says it) that will have you coming back. The town of Perast itself is charming, walkable, and a place I would consider buying property. Make sure you walk up the stone staircases to find secret gardens and ancient chapels. The 5EUR boat ride to the manmade island (the other is private) is a rip-off, although the small church itself is lovely inside (1EUR). Ask for a boat tour around the bay instead, or hike up to Gornji Stoliv (Donji Stoliv is an unimpressive fishermans town). Perast is the gem of this bay. Restoran Conte and Palace Jelena have the best service. Food is good everywhere. And go find the wisteria courtyard :) Thank you for opening your home, Nela!!"
2791283,66750688,2017-03-30T07:37:20Z,Had the best few days here! Nela was very informative and helpful! The place is great and the view from the balcony was amazing! Perast is such a beautiful place and Kotor isn't far away either! Definitely want to come back! 
2791283,6305653,2017-03-15T08:05:53Z,"appartement bien placé, terrasse super face au Kotor"
2791283,42790754,2017-03-06T10:10:11Z,Friendly host..good location..Quite area..much better to stay in summer time.
2791283,17424695,2016-12-08T08:06:06Z,"Nice and helpful host, wonderful place to stay in Perast. Spectacular view from terrace."
2791283,5106463,2016-10-18T06:42:21Z,"Overall, great experience staying at Nela's place in Perast !! :) Awesome communication before arriving and she sent lots of information about the history of the town, apartment, recommendations for what to see, where to eat, etc. beforehand. The apartment is older, which was expected, and has all the amenities needed - hair dryer, shampoo, towels, kitchen essentials, etc. but the TV does not work. Granted, we didn't mind because the location and patio are incredible and we were mostly outside. Amazing views. The only issue we ran into was that it was raining heavily the first 2 days we were there and had trouble with the Wifi working and assumed it was from the weather. But, got Wifi at local restaurants nearby easily so it wasn't a problem.

The town is small, one short road on the water, but we ended up loving the people, restaurants, charm, etc . in Perast more than Kotor. We had rented a car so it was easy to drive to nearby towns and we were able to park in front of the house without any problems. Kotor was about a 20 minute drive but if you don't have a car there was a local bus that went by the apartment frequently throughout the day. 

Would highly recommend renting kayaks from the man that runs the boat to/from the tiny island in the bay right outside the front door of the apartment. The bay was insanely calm and we kayaked out to the islands ourselves. 

End of story, this place is a great value, incredibly charming, and would stay here again on a heartbeat!"
2791283,48778382,2016-10-13T02:41:20Z,"From our first contact with Nela we were treated with great care.  Every message was promptly replied to Nela made us feel confident that we were in good hands.  We were!  The apartment was very well represented in the photos.  It is a perfect studio, and the downstairs bath ideal use of the space.  The terrace is obviously the highlight of Nela's Apartment!  We LOVED our view and enjoyed the friendly Boatmen's banter below as tourist paid their short visit to ""Our"" lovely town and islands.  While not secluded, we enjoyed sitting, quiet hidden, on the terrace as the visitors past below. According to our new friend Nikola (Boatman) Nela has The Best Terrace in town!  We agree!.. Perast itself is indescribably charming with a surprisingly large amount of restaurants to choose from (at least during the season).  There is only one small grocery shop, but larger can be found  quite close in Risan and Kotor. You won't regret staying at Nela's!"
2791283,36464373,2016-09-25T08:04:09Z,"We had a fantastic three days staying in Nela's apartment in Perast. The patio was absolutely amazing. We found ourselves sitting on the patio at all times of the day being memorised by the incredible scenery.  

Nela provided us with lots of information prior to our arrival. Her local contact Anka checked us in and helped us out with all of our other questions. Everything was seamless.

I would definitely recommend Nela's apartment and I hope to come back for a visit in the future(URL HIDDEN)"
2791283,26319986,2016-09-19T01:44:56Z,"Wecwere greetedcatvtge property at a time to suit us, which was greatly appreciated. We were shown all the amenities and wished a good stay. We had contact details should we have any questions/problems. "
2791283,42376878,2016-08-20T03:03:54Z,"There are two reasons why you should book this apartment. 1) it's got the most amazing terrace, so that you can sit and stare at the Kotor Bay all day. 2) Nela was a great host - she always answered any questions immediately and was really helpful - only a shame we never met her, as I felt I knew her from our emails! We spend 9 nights at Nela's and found Perast a really relaxing place to be. The apartment is right by the road (which you don't see from Terrace, but do hear). Buses will stop outside apartment going in either direction around the bay. You can swim within yards of apartment, & there are many café / restaurants a few minutes away. Although Perast is busy in the day, it's much quieter in the evenings. The best thing about the apartment is the terrace & the view - go! "
2791283,9569384,2016-08-10T01:49:47Z,"Le charme de ce logement est la superbe terrasse avec une vue exceptionnelle sur les Bouches de Kotor. Le logement est bien équipé et propre. Perast est une petite ville pleine de charme avec ses anciens palais vénitiens. Elle est aussi bien située pour visiter la région.
"
2791283,1592257,2016-08-05T01:09:29Z,"Excellent communication! Arrived and light was not working and was fixed within one hour.
Aircon was not great and needed emptying every few hours.
Musty smell when we arrived (presumably when room is locked up?). Steps to bathroom maybe awkward for some.
The immediate sea front was however very busy after 9am until 6pm with tourists and boat trips. Avoiding July-August may be best if you can.
Brilliant music festival over our weekend.
Highlight was stunning view from terrace and kayaking and swimming to islands.

"
2791283,74459829,2016-07-29T00:35:32Z,The large terrace with its fantastic view is the main reason we'd love to go back to this place! The apartment itself is well equipped with a kitchen and air-conditioning and the quirky antique décor is nice. Perast is a small town but has a number of good restaurants and would be a good base to explore the area. Communication with Nela (and her assistants) was friendly and straightforward. Thanks for a great stay!
2791283,8170107,2016-07-17T01:06:32Z,"We were very happy with everything with this place. The views from the terrace are simply stunning, and it was a true blessing having breakfast there in the mornings. It was lovely to take a swim from the small pier below the flat. Communication with Nela was great and made the visit easy. Would recommend! "
2791283,9725352,2016-07-12T01:23:41Z,Perfect location! Flat had a lot of character and was very clean. Would definitely recommend staying here. Nela was a very attentive host.
735683,64676015,2017-05-09T06:20:04Z,The climb to reach the apartment was tiring but the view was worth it. The host held our bags when we arrived earlier than check in and they were in our apartment waiting for us at check in. 
735683,49606286,2017-05-06T07:21:55Z,"We had a great time in Hvar. The Island is amazing and the view from this apartment is just spectacular. The apartment had everything we needed and was walking distance to all the public areas. There was also good communication between us and the host, they were quick to respond to all of our queries and were extremely helpful. We will definitely recommend Ivana and Lorenzo's place."
735683,8473108,2017-05-04T07:27:49Z,"Die Ferienwohnung ist geräumig und modern eingerichtet und die Küche hat einen modernen Herd und einen großen Geschirrspieler. Außergewöhnlich ist der schöne Blick auf die Stadt und den Hafen von Hvar, den man von der herrlichen Terrasse im Garten genießen kann."
735683,2870554,2017-04-25T08:16:12Z,We had a lovely time in Hvar and Ivana and Lorenzo's place has the best view from the outdoor living room!  Thank you for helping us get settled and being responsive.
735683,5332726,2017-04-17T07:22:00Z,Ivana and Lorenzo's place was wonderful.  It was perfectly located and had an amazing vie of Hvar.  It was quiet and lovely.  
735683,39185197,2017-04-13T07:22:22Z,The apartment has the best view in all of Hvar. It is easy to get into town as you just have to walk down some steps and parking was really easy too. The best part was sitting out on the patio watching the sun set with a bottle of local wine and some Pag cheese! We will be back! 
735683,104636231,2017-04-07T09:12:34Z,"Las vistas son lo mejor de la casa, se trata de un apartamento bien equipado y la comunicación con Ivana & Lorenzo fue perfecta"
735683,26522933,2017-04-03T08:32:42Z,"A great apartment, exactly as described. The views over Hvar are wonderful. We loved having our breakfast in the garden. The apartment was very cleanand tidy and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"
735683,19630824,2017-03-30T06:32:21Z,"My wife and I stayed in this apartment, which has one of the best views in all of Hvar Town!  We enjoyed wine from the picnic table overlooking the City, and the location is an easy walk down some stairs to the center.  The apartment has been updated, and made for a great stay.  Thanks!"
735683,54092305,2017-03-29T06:28:45Z,"Ivana & Lorenzo were great hosts, brilliant at communicating& giving directions. Our first ferry was cancelled so we got to Hvar late& missed the supermarket closing and they kindly borrowed us some milk which helped us. It was out if season so we were struggling to arrange transport for an early ferry to Bol& they very kindly booked us a taxi. Great views from the apartment, terrace was beautiful& we had breakfast here. It is about a 10min walk from the harbour where the ferry stops- up many steps, but I vanan's brother meet us up the last set of steps& helped us with the suitcase. Very comfy pillows& beds. Kitchen fully equipped & toilet roll/ shower gel included. The tv kept losing signal which was a pain the first night as we stopped in, but not a major problem. Apartment is a stone throw away from the castle. Great stay & we thank you for your hospitality 

Love Heather& Alan xx"
735683,118570380,2017-03-17T08:20:40Z,"STUNNING view, central location, really can't recommend enough. Beautiful outdoor patio with a view. The apartment was spotless. Only thing is there isn't much of a communal space inside (but for a small dining table) but given how gorgeous the patio is it wasn't a problem. "
735683,6649652,2017-03-15T09:50:02Z,"Terrific place up on the hill with a great view overlooking Hvar. We went in the off season but they helped us a great deal by letting us know what was still open, and went out of their way to ensure we had a good stay."
735683,109881075,2017-03-05T07:57:00Z,"There is very nice place. 
Amazing view in the room. And friendly host! I recommend this apartment!!"
735683,92859479,2017-01-10T10:07:51Z,"Ivana and Lorenzo were out of town when my friend and I arrived to Hvar, but their family was waiting for us. They were very helpful and showed us around the apartment and provided us with extra heaters as it was chilly outside during our stay. They also provided us with a binder including wifi information, maps, ferry schedules, etc. Whenever we had a question and sent a message they promptly responded and Ivana's family even helped us greatly when the electric turned off due to us using too many things at once. They allowed us to stay in their apartment and called the electric company to solve the problem. They were even going to put us up into another apartment if it couldn't be fixed that night. Overall, we had a really great experience at the residence. We would recommend the apartment and the hosts for those interested in a stay at Hvar. It really does have a great view. While there may seem to be a lot of stairs, I would say it's worth it and you're even closer to the fortresses. "
735683,27036338,2016-11-14T10:19:57Z,"Communication with Ivana and Lorenzo was excellent , especially as they responded to an enquiry very late at night.Lorenzo was very friendly and kindly met us at the bus station and drove us to the apartment. It would have been difficult to find otherwise and very hard with heavy luggage. Undeniably the apartment is in a great spot with magnificent views however quite honestly we were underwhelmed by the apartment itself. After having an amazing airbnb experience in Split and then paying top dollar in Hvar we were disappointed to find the apartment to be so spartan. We were also surprised to find that the only living area is up an outdoor flight of stairs in the uncovered garden terrace.The combined kitchen/dining is very small, just possible for two persons. Obviously I didn't look at photo's carefully enough. Nevertheless we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights. We were fortunate to have amazingly beautiful weather and though the season was definitely over with most tourists gone and bars etc closed this suited us perfectly.There are quite a few stairs down into the town , but they are manageable , and yes , the views are definitely worth the exercise!"
735683,73599692,2016-11-11T09:39:32Z,"The place was really nice, I think we just went in the wrong timing because I can see that the season in Hvar ends in September and we went in November, I'm sure we would have enjoyed the great terrace if it was sunny but the weather wasn't so great so we stayed mostly at the apartment, which was really nice as well and with a great view from the windows. The hosts were kind to give recommendations for restaurants and so but they were mostly closed because the season was over. We struggled with bringing our heavy luggage up to (and down from) the apartment - lots of stairs - but otherwise everything was great, clean and well-equipped. "
735683,78541868,2016-10-30T07:50:56Z,"Look no further (trust me I researched so many places!) and choose this apartment for your stay in Hvar! Light and bright, peaceful and quiet with a gorgeous view of the water - you will love this place! Was perfect for us as was close to the ferry and restaurants in a gorgeous part of town. Would recommend to anyone, and would love to come back! "
735683,19746804,2016-10-30T03:16:54Z,Es entsprach genau der Aufmachung im Internet. Gerd und ich wurden freundlich empfangen und mit verschiedenen Aufmerksamkeiten verwöhnt. Lorenzo war für Fragen ansprechbar. Gerne komme ich wieder. Mfg anita berndt
735683,9650393,2016-10-20T06:41:20Z,"This is a truly lovely location. Beautiful space, views, and access to everything Hvar has to offer. Highly recommend as the best place to stay in Hvar. And the garden terrace is simply amazing for a glass of wine in the evening or coffee in the morning! You can't go wrong with this fantastic spot! "
735683,6816195,2016-10-19T00:02:33Z,"We had a great time at Ivana and Lorenzo's place. Everything was perfect, from the beginning to the end. Lorenzo picked us up from the port and brought us to the apartment, so no problem with finding it in the beginning. The apartment is small and cozy and has an amazing view... I couldn't get away from the window and terrace. All in all a very pleasant experience and I would always go back, thanks a lot for everything"
355474,16688053,2017-05-01T18:29:18Z,"I spent two nights in the Suite Mirador. I was traveling alone, but the whole family (I met Rubén, Meli y la dueña de la casa) was welcoming and made me feel at ease. Breakfast was delicious, the space tranquil and with a wonderful view. I would recommend to anyone looking to find peace in Valpo. Muchas gracias por una buena experiencia!"
355474,125682569,2017-04-23T16:57:21Z,"Un ""suite"" encantador con duena carinosa, atenta y con vista privilegiada de 360 grados, muy lindo estilo, madera, azul y blanco"
355474,93496349,2017-04-21T13:17:09Z,"Nina y Pilar son anfitrionas excelentes, y la casa preciosa. Solo quedamos por una noche, pero la habitación tenía todo lo que necesitabamos. Lo más bonito fue la vista de amanecer de la habitación en la mañana. "
355474,18458885,2017-04-16T16:54:00Z,"Buen lugar, bonito y con anfitriones muy preocupados de solucionar los detalles. Eso sí te tienen que gustar mucho los gatos pues andan constantemente dando vueltas por la habitación."
355474,106280009,2017-04-14T12:37:23Z,"We had a great stay at Suite Mirador. The view from the house is amazing! The owners are very friendly and were always there to help us. The touristical area is easily reachable by bus or by a nice walk via Artilleria, from which you will have a great view on the harbour and the city. The only point for improvement could be the cleanliness, since you will share the house with two (beautiful!) cats who won't hesitate to leave their hairs and odor. We would definitly recommend staying in Suite Mirador!"
355474,115733365,2017-04-03T12:42:00Z,"There was a lack of communication with the host but overall, the location was close to public transit and sites."

355474,90424418,2017-03-26T13:49:41Z,"The room is as beautiful as in the pictures. Lina, the landlady is absolutely lovely and happy to help. Our only big problem was that the room was infested of mosquitos during the night, we couldn't sleep more than a couple of hours with the light on and we ended up leaving super early in the morning totally frustrated."
355474,116466951,2017-03-25T11:12:32Z,"Great place with a view! Everyone is so nice, great breakfasts too! "
355474,27798224,2017-03-21T11:08:42Z,"The suite is very pretty and really charming. Having Breakfast enjoying the sea view is just wonderful.
You would need to take the bus to go to the tourist area, which was fine by us. The street noise can be loud so I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper."

355474,25504998,2017-03-18T14:31:03Z,Hospitable family and nice historic home. 25 minute walk/funicular ride from the tourist center in Cerro Alegre and Cerro Concepcion is the only downside. Thank you! 
355474,83099640,2017-03-15T12:49:04Z,La habitación es un sueño. Tiene unas vistas increíbles de todo Valparaíso. Nina es un amor. Súper dulce y cálida. El desayuno muy rico. Tiene buena comunicación hacia el cerro Alegre. Nos encanto! Volveríamos sin dudas.

Beautiful views from the rooms upstairs and very comfy bed. 
Many buses around, but a nice walk to stay in shape to and from center town. Many steps for someone not capable but there is a 'teleferico' ride you can use.

355474,12284414,2017-03-08T12:46:57Z,Beautiful old house with character and a stunning view. The hosts were very friendly and we felt comfortable. 
355474,22194320,2017-02-28T13:23:33Z,"This is such a wonderful place to stay!  While it is difficult to get to the first time if you aren't familiar with the bus system of Valparaiso, upon arrival the hosts can help you out to easily get anywhere you want in the city and beyond!  The pictures are accurate- it is a beautifully done space with an incredible view.  The breakfast was a wonderful way to start the day since there is no kitchen attached to the room, and we enjoyed every moment.  The hosts are friendly and helpful - they certainly made our stay in Valparaiso very special!"
355474,4765642,2017-02-26T12:41:28Z,"The suite is as pretty as pictures, located an easy walk to the ascensor artilleria which is a lovely spot and gateway to the rest of the town. A sweet little older lady made breakfast for us and gave us tips on walking tours before we left. We were also able to park in the driveway which was very convenient. Would recommend if you are visiting Valparaiso, but may not be ideal for those with cat allergies."
355474,35277836,2017-02-25T11:06:06Z,"We loved this beautiful attic suite at the top of a family home. The blue room provided a much needed relaxing space (especially after tiring ourselves out walking the hills of Valpo). The family thoughtfully provided us with a breakfast tray every day. The bedroom and bathroom each have a door, but the blue room is open to the top of the stairs. This means the everyday family happenings can be heard from the space, which didn't bother us but may be of note to some guests."
355474,3679526,2017-02-19T11:41:07Z,"This is a really special place to stay, with the cosiness and atmosphere of a well-loved family home. The location is great - a manageable walk by day and a short taxi or bus ride by night from the centre of Valpo - and the neighbourhood itself is great, full of fantastic old wooden houses, cute squares etc. The views from the suite are amazing, and the home-made breakfast is a really cute touch. "
355474,9593175,2017-02-11T11:33:07Z,"Sem dúvida, a Suíte Mirador tem uma das melhores vistas de Valparaíso e, só por isso, já vale a estadia. A dona Nina também foi muito atenciosa e nos deu várias informações importantes sobre a cidade, as atrações e o sistema de transporte. A localização da casa é em Playa Ancha, longe do agito dos Cerros Alegre e Concepción, o que, na nossa opinião, é muito bom pelo silêncio e pela tranquilidade à noite. Mesmo assim, há cafés, restaurantes e mercadinhos na volta. Os ônibus passam na esquina da casa e com uma caminhada bem tranquila se chega ao Mirador 21 de Mayo, ao lado do Museu Marítimo. É uma ótima experiência para duas ou três noites. "
1796816,13696305,2017-05-10T20:22:23Z,"Beautiful is not what makes this place special.  Sure, it’s gorgeous, but gorgeous is what Maui is supposed to be about.  For my Jennie and me, the thing that made this gingerbread house so memorable was the way we transformed between arrival and departure.  

We came preoccupied and left at peace.  

Much of this can be attributed to the little gingerbread house itself (for which you will find reviews aplenty herein), but the true difference was Eve and her little labyrinth.  We came and experienced the unexpected and departed more than we were.  I can’t promise the same for you, but I can, and do hope.  "
1796816,7088504,2017-05-06T18:19:40Z,This was a gorgeous place to stay for our three nights in Maui. A great location to explore the island from. Clean and convenient!
1796816,27090787,2017-05-03T20:08:50Z,"Beautiful house , great location and an amazing host. 
Clean and tidy, small house- but has everything you need.
Definitely worth trying out!"
1796816,82320668,2017-04-30T18:57:33Z,Small private getaway.  Steve did an amazing job with the bath and shower. Quiet and naturally beautiful.
1796816,94833248,2017-04-23T19:43:41Z,"The highlight of our stay.  Beautiful and cozy wee house, all the comforts we required, gorgeous peaceful jungly yard with wonderful strolling areas and a burbling creek. Friendly-neighbour chickens to share our afternoon lounging.  Wholly secluded, yet only a short drive to central/north coast centres.  If we return to Maui, timing will depend on being able to stay here again."
1796816,26328042,2017-04-18T21:20:18Z,"Great location for exploring Maui's upcountry. Beautiful grounds with fruit trees, creek, nursery/garden and a labyrinth! Bed was extra soft and comfortable. Large bathroom. Great lighting and lots of windows. "
1796816,55611286,2017-04-15T20:43:23Z,"Wow, this place was awesome.  We stayed in the gingerbread house for our honeymoon and loved it.  If you're looking to stay off the beaten path on Maui, this is your place.  Away from the touristy crowds of West Maui, the house is secluded and among beautiful greenery in the upcountry.  It's close the the tiny town of Makawao, a hidden gem, with cute shops and restaurants.  Eve was so accommodating and the house was equipped with everything we needed.  There are numerous chickens roaming the property, so be aware that there may be some early morning wakeup calls!"
1796816,117575788,2017-04-12T21:08:18Z,"We chose the cottage as a place to stay central in east Maui and loved staying here! Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived (our only request for next time is extra visits from Bodhi the dog!). The house was easy to find, check in was simple, Eve met us in person and gave a detailed intro to the house and property. The home was beautiful, clean, smelled wonderful, and had everything available that you would need including beach towels, umbrella, styrofoam cooler, coffee pot, fridge, toaster oven, working internet and cell phone service. The property is quiet and beautiful. It was about an hour's drive to the top of Haleakala. Thank you for making our stay great!"
1796816,27293779,2017-04-09T19:15:41Z,"The Gingerbread Cottage is quaint, clean, and charming. Had all the room we needed in a beautiful private jungle setting. A great off-the-beaten-path alternative to the resort approach To Hawaiian vacationing "
1796816,102159497,2017-03-29T18:05:53Z,"The cottage was beautiful and clean, well appointed and open-feeling with lots of windows looking into the tropical yard and all the amenities one needs. (Microwave,coffee maker,hair dryer,fridge,rice cooker, blender, juicer, ample lighting options, and guest robes.) The trees and landscape and lush meadow provide amazing photo opps. The property includes The Sacred Garden, a serene greenhouse, shop, and walking labyrinths with a calming Zen essence, wonderful staff and smart African Grey parrot. We definitely plan a return visit in hopes that the stream will be running! Eve is a gracious hostess who responded immediately to every request."
1796816,5326016,2017-03-21T21:28:29Z,"Eve's place was a dream - the highlight of our stay in Maui. We loved every minute here and Eve did an incredible job to make our stay as perfect as possible. The cottage was equipped with everything we could need, the bed was incredibly comfortable, Eve gave amazing suggestions about things to do and places to eat, and the location was central, away from tourists and a dream. It was stunningly beautiful and relaxing to stay in the jungle and I highly recommend this to anyone! "
1796816,70578507,2017-03-19T03:31:34Z,"The Gingerbread Cottage is a charming, clean, quiet, and peaceful little house in the middle of a very unique, rainforest property.  We thought the cottage was the perfect home base for exploring every inch of Maui.
The cottage was visually appealing and well kept.  The aromatic cedar paneling throughout the house gives a rustic appeal; the bathroom is pure modern pleasure! 
The property around the cottage is fascinating; lush and full of an amazing variety of plants and trees.  There are bananas, tangerines, lemons, papayas, coconuts, and more—and you are encouraged to taste-test what you find!  Eve and Steve shared an avocado with us, grown on the property.  The avocado was as big as our four fists put together and tasted like butter.  Yummy!  Speaking of Eve and Steve (and Bodhi)…very welcoming, laid back, accomplished individuals!  They are so generous to share their lovely property with those of us lucky enough to happen upon it.  We would stay again, in a heartbeat.
Final note:  some have commented that the eco-water heater is less than ideal, but we had no problems at all with the amount or temperature of the water during our showers.
"
1796816,92492500,2017-03-15T08:23:32Z,"There is nowhere better if you wish for some peace in the countryside where the only sounds are the wind in the trees and the sound of the birds.

A charming house and charming hosts who are always available to answer queries but never intrusive.

Totally recommended."
1796816,14340327,2017-03-13T12:01:06Z,"Eve was a great host and the place was exactly as described. It is in the middle of a jungle and is a bit of a drive the the popular west and south sides of the island, perfect location for the Road to Hana and some of the smaller towns in the Upcountry. Because it's in the middle of a jungle there are wildlife which I think Eve mentions in the description, roosters crowing, little critters making noises and lots of birds and such. The hot water is a little short sided but that might depend on how many other occupants are on the property, the week we were there it was full. There is a washer/dryer that was handy, a small blow dryer, an iron and beach towels available as well as anything you'd need in a kitchen. Overall, it was a great experience and we'd stay again. "
1796816,90228239,2017-03-04T01:21:41Z,"This is the most beautiful little place to stay imaginable. The owners are so kind , helpful and friendly and we were so happy to experience a slice of heaven in these exotic and abundant surroundings."
1796816,14837085,2017-02-28T21:13:22Z,"The gingerbread house is a super cute little cottage in the middle of an amazing magical garden! Eve was wonderful if helping us get settled in. The space was clean, and the nature was beautiful!"
1796816,7948195,2017-02-27T02:36:54Z,"Beautiful Location, great host, everything very tidy and just perfect! "
1796816,174506,2017-02-20T11:57:22Z,A ver cozy cottage! 
1796816,40913349,2017-02-12T00:49:24Z,"02/08 to 02/11/17. The jungle setting is very beautiful and peaceful with many interesting birds and plants, including many fruit trees. The house is small and clean. The bed is soft and comfortable. Eve is gracious and kind. We would not hesitate to go back to Gingerbread House."
1796816,16490343,2017-02-05T21:45:38Z,"Very sweet and private location. Great for those interested in a private stay in Maui. If you want to cook at home, note that kitchenette is quite small and the counter-top hot plate is less to optimal. We found the bed to be too soft, but if that is what you like, then you are in luck. The entire place was very clean, and it was nice to sit outside on the back patio eating breakfast in the morning sun or enjoying a glass of wine in the evening (although the mosquitoes make the late afternoon and evening less than optimal).
Over-all good to very-good, and potentially better depending on your preferences and requirements."
939721,16588365,2017-05-02T13:22:28Z,"Couldn't recommend a better place to stay in Mexico City. Alex's place, especially in the Roma Norte area is an oasis from the intensity of the city. A perfect area for wandering from restaurants to bars at night and embracing the night life of the city. Alex's place was the cleanest AIR bnb's we've ever stayed in. Just one note. Don't forget to use Mosquito spray before you head to bed. Luckily, Alex had Mosquito plug in repellent chargers to use. His place is very well equipped and the perfect place to stay. If we go back to Mexico city again we plan to stay again! Thank you Alex."
939721,75131978,2017-04-28T14:20:34Z,"Incredible location and fantastic views of the city, accomodation was absolutely perfect!"
939721,840692,2017-04-24T14:55:28Z,"El lugar estaba súper y tal cual como aparece en las fotos! 

The place was increíble and exactly as described!"
939721,2649212,2017-04-20T16:20:59Z,"Alex's flat was lovely to stay in. If you get a chance, do watch the sunrise/set/rainstorm from the patio. The neighborhood was great, as were his helpers who let us in. Was our favourite location for our CDMX trip. "
939721,8801273,2017-04-17T15:20:45Z,"Alex's apartment is amazing. An oasis of quiet in one of CDMX's best neighbourhoods. The roof terrace is a great spot to chill out before exploring the cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. There's also loads of Ecobici bikes nearby so you can cycle to the downtown area."
939721,51178282,2017-04-12T16:56:05Z,"Being able to sit out on the terrace after a long flight was great, there are many helpful restaurant tips and the area is great. Everything you need for a cool stay in Mexico City."
939721,45842433,2017-04-09T20:55:41Z,"Alex estuvo súper al pendiente todo el tiempo, incluyendo mi arribo un poco más tarde de lo acordado. El lugar está súper ubicado y te permite moverte con mucha facilidad en la zona, la terraza es funcional y deliciosa de noche.. de las mejores opciones de la zona "
939721,13884289,2017-04-07T16:36:19Z,Fantastic place on a rooftop with a very nice and scenic garden in the middle of the great Roma area full of excellent food options. Highly recommendable.
939721,50540133,2017-04-04T15:53:55Z,Super cool apartment in a lovely part of town. Great communication from Alex who helped us check in after midnight which was awesome. Loved the roof top garden. Just remember it is a roof top so fair few flights of stairs to get up if you have awkward bags :) 
939721,14815514,2017-03-31T17:39:42Z,"Fantastic location and the terrace was awesome! We did not have hot water the first morning but after contacting Alex and Laura within a few hours the problem was resolved. It was very private and overall peaceful. The bed was a bit firm for my liking but that is personal preference. While it is in a neighborhood, there still can be noise including a nearby dog that enjoyed barking. Overall, it is a wonderful place to stay."
939721,40794279,2017-03-22T17:37:35Z,"Great stay, beautiful place."
939721,1224989,2017-03-17T16:10:50Z,The lift is amazing and so is the neighborhood! The host was great at comuunicating/great at arranging someone to come and greet me. Such a beautiful space. I really enjoyed my stay. Thank you Alex. 
939721,13462664,2017-03-15T17:11:15Z,Place was very much as described. Great location - amazing patio. Alex went above and beyond as a host. 
939721,4499759,2017-03-09T14:09:04Z,"Hidden on the top floor of a quiet street in Mexico City is architect Alex's lovely apartment, which was designed by himself and is actually the first passive house in all of Latin America. The aesthetic is both charming and industrial: exposed structure, OSB, and DIY elements give it a fun and playful atmosphere. The best part is the roof deck which almost as large as the apartment and is filled with plants and light, enjoyable at any time of the day or night. I want to live here. Highly recommended. "
939721,10389657,2017-03-03T15:20:35Z,"This is the best Airbnb you can stay in Mexico City. Incredible location, unique character and beautiful design in the apartment. 
Lovely balcony overlooking the city with plants everywhere. 
What a pleasure to stay here!!!!"
939721,321010,2017-02-28T16:08:47Z,"A super tranquil and very well designed hideaway in the centre of the city. The vast terrace and open plan living were dreamy. Really well equipped with all you need for a city break (including an all-important coffee machine to start the day properly!) 
Alex was super communicative and although not there to greet us, made clear arrangements for a smooth check in. No downsides to this place, but be prepared for carrying your suitcase up a spiral staircase. Challenging but fun! "
939721,101714,2017-02-25T15:46:37Z,"We had a fantastic time staying in La Roma and coming home in the evenings to sit on the stunning terrace! Be prepared to walk up many, many stairs, including a narrow spiral staircase at the end.  There is a fun playground nearby if you have children, and the most fantastic tacos right on the corner. "
939721,19729449,2017-02-15T17:37:33Z,"The location is wonderful, in a hip bustling part of town. The patio is incredible and a delight to be able to lay in the sun during the day and to watch the sunset and look over the city in the evening. The loft is small but very comfortable. Would love to return :)"
939721,105833401,2017-02-12T18:36:12Z,Great spot!
939721,6505212,2017-02-02T15:29:19Z,Alex's loft is a lot of fun. Even though it is rather small it feels very spacious and the huge patio is perfect for hanging out in he sun or barbecue. The area offers plenty restaurants and bars in walking distance. Can recommend!
443684,36704029,2017-05-06T11:15:19Z,"This is a GREAT spot and very convenient for exploring Copenhagen and beyond. The home is clean, neat, and very tastefully put together - a classic Danish cozy home 5 floors above fray. My kids didn't want to leave (and the stairs didn't phase them a bit!). Sabrina made us feel like we were house guests and then she disappeared for our entire stay - exactly the way an AirBNB experience was intended to be. When we come back to Copenhagen, this is where we would like to return."
443684,113878066,2017-05-03T13:18:33Z,"Ładnie urządzone, czyste, dobrze wyposażone mieszkanie. Dobry dojazd do centrum miasta. "
443684,3536268,2017-05-01T07:27:52Z,"Our stay in Copenhagen was great! Sabrina was kind and replied to our messages straight away. 
The flat is perfectly located: you can have a short bike ride or bus ride into town. Lovely surroundings and super nice and clean flat. I would strongly suggest to stay at her place! Tak! "
443684,36807607,2017-04-29T06:09:18Z,"The Edmond's flat was really confortable, with lot of space. The flat has everything you need for a pleasant stay in Copenhague. 
Communication with Edmond was perfect. "
443684,20948093,2017-04-24T07:08:05Z,"Had an amazing stay at Edmond's! Extremely comfortable and well maintained. Easy to get to the city center (via bus or bike rental) and close to some nice shops and restaurants. Communication was very easy. Edmond was always clear and quick to respond. I would highly recommend staying here, the place provided for a perfect weekend in Copenhagen!"
443684,10359816,2017-04-22T07:36:31Z,Die Wohnung ist ideal für eine kleine Gruppe oder eine Familie. Wir haben Fahrräder gemietet und waren so in Kürze im Zentrum. Der Kontakt mit Edmond wahr sehr angenehm und wir wurden in der Wohnung herzlich empfangen. Wir würden diese Wohnung sofort wieder mieten! Sehr zu empfehlen!
443684,103312576,2017-04-15T07:53:24Z,We had a good time
443684,59627906,2017-04-02T09:26:41Z,"Hyggelig og fint sted, alt var som forespeilet og vi koste oss riktig mye :) "
443684,101569877,2017-03-26T09:34:24Z,5 stories up with no elevator but we loved the light and the views.  Clean gorgeous modern spaces worth the climb.
443684,24162721,2017-03-17T08:18:23Z,"Edmond's apartment was the perfect stay for our 4 day trip to Copenhagen. The apartment is clean, bright and stylish, and well located for reaching central Copenhagen. There were 6 in our group (3 couples) and it felt spacious even with only one bathroom, which was manageable. We felt very welcomed to Copenhagen and could not have asked for a better host. Thank you :-)"
443684,67895822,2017-03-12T08:17:56Z,"This is a comfortable and stylish flat suitable for families, groups and party people. The apartment is bursting with natural light and the interior is mostly Scandinavian design level. Bars and better restaurants are scarce in the neighbourhood, but there are a lot of supermarkets and it's easy to take a bus downtown as the stop is just in front of the building. Climbing five flights of stairs is worth the effort, as the balconies offer a nice view over Copenhagen. Our experience was great, and our hosts were very friendly and helpful."
443684,54364880,2017-03-09T07:32:50Z,"A great apartment in Norrebro, bus station just outside the door which takes you to the metro. Not a long ride downtown if taxi is preferred. We used uber all the time and it's about 100 dkr downtown.

Everything about the apartment is great!"
443684,111891376,2017-03-05T08:41:30Z,"En dejlig rummelig lejlighed, velegnet til 3 par + evt. 2 til 4 børn. Dejlig lyst og rimelig rolig trods beliggenheden op af en stor vej.
Super nemt med bus til og fra centrum, men det er også muligt at gå hvis man vil det."
443684,79710505,2017-03-03T09:42:00Z,"Wir wurden extrem herzlich und freundlich in Empfang genommen, obwohl wir erst um 22:00 Uhr wegen Zugverspaetung ankamen.  Alles perfekt! Fûr 10 Personen genau das, was wir suchten! Super ausgestattet!"
443684,56020230,2017-02-28T10:08:42Z,"We spent six weeks living here and could not have asked for more welcoming or hospitable hosts, anything we needed help with they were immediately there for us. The place is very cosy and warm but also very comfortable for large groups. It is in a great location in Nørrebro and is only a short cycle to the city centre. It is close to buses and trains and within short walking distance to bars, restaurants, supermarkets and the main street of Nørrebrogade.
We have had a great experience here and would highly recommend it!"
443684,51727951,2017-01-08T09:32:56Z,we were very happy with the overall experience of visiting this lovely apartment. Henrietta was fantastic - letting us in an hour early and letting us leave our cases in the apartment until we had to get our flight. The apartment was lovely and we really felt at home. The 5 flights of stairs and one bathroom may put people off but we didnt feel it was an issue - the view is well worth it and there were 4 couples and we managed to all shower etc every day. The area is great - bus stop right outside but would recommend everyone to try uber if there are more than 3 people - much cheaper than buses!!!! Apartment is close to lovely shops and we found lovely restaurants ( 2 of the party were vegan and fantastic vegan restaurants in Copenhagen!!) The apartment is well equipped and we wouldnt hesitate to recommend this as a place to stay in Copenhagen!!
443684,28564600,2017-01-01T09:31:59Z,"The flat was very warm and welcoming with clear access arrangements. 
Description of how to get there very good. 
Good amenities on door step. Worth exploring local cafes as cheaper than central. We found a great local smorrbrod cafe that was excellent value. 
Lots of stairs for people with limited mobility!

443684,21448461,2016-12-17T10:13:37Z,Top notch host and accommodation. Absolutely lovely penthouse that is right in front of the bus stop! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
6712472,1120780,2017-05-07T09:34:58Z,"I loved my stay at Susan's home. She was a very warm and friendly person, and made me feel very welcome from the minute I arrived. The room was nice and comfy, the bathroom was huge, and the whole house was very clean. I enjoyed breakfast each morning with Susan and other guests - she has a few regulars who come here all the time because they like it so much!

Unfortunately I didn't have much time to explore the area, which is a bit further out from Central London. Susan told me there's lots of good Indian food though. It's an easy walk to the tube or bus to head into the city."
6712472,47414909,2017-05-01T08:47:24Z,The room was really nice; had everything I needed and had a nice bed. Breakfast is included and it has a big bath in the bathroom
6712472,9975550,2017-04-25T08:32:18Z,"If I could rate Susan and her home more than 5 stars, I would! Susan is great and the room was perfect. I would DEFINITELY stay here again."
6712472,105797510,2017-04-07T10:05:58Z,"Susan is a very nice host in every aspect. She is really patient and kind, being helpful at anytime, and she would offer you with things you need. Rooms are clean and tidy, and things are well prepared. I really love the decorations in the rooms. Wonderful experience here. Even though it is a little bit far away from train stations, I would still say it is a great place to stay."
6712472,57526074,2017-04-06T08:12:52Z,"Ayaan is a gracious and kind host.  Her home it's clean and in pretty good repair.

I would stay again."
6712472,23224682,2017-04-02T10:36:08Z,"Had a great stay at Susan's and the room felt bright and cheerful. By the second day, I didn't really need a map to get from Upton Park station back to her place so that was good (I recommend that you download CityMapper app to get around). The Central line is always TOO crowded and I'm not sure I'd stay anywhere along Central tube line, so it's great that you can take District or Hammersmity&City straight to Upton Park. The surrounding area felt safe but of course use your judgment; some nights there's people hanging outside a bar near Upton Park station. "
6712472,83714678,2017-03-25T11:41:16Z,Accommodation comfortable as described. Susan is a wonderful host. I definitely recommend!
6712472,34747420,2017-03-23T09:58:28Z,Everything was great!  Sue very nice and helpful. Whole house immaculate and the room great with double bed. Breakfast too! Excellent in every way! Next time in London shall hopefully be staying again!
6712472,115168,2017-03-18T09:38:24Z,"Me he alojado en casa de Susan durante cinco días. El alojamiento está ubicado algo alejado del centro, sin embargo tengo que destacar su amabilidad y el interés porque me sintiera a gusto,  como en casa. Un alojamiento sin duda a tener en cuenta. "
6712472,78496208,2017-03-12T11:46:30Z,"What a fabulous treat home away from home. Beautiful room and an incredibly comfy, clean, welcoming home. Susan is fantastic and a fabulous host. Would highly recommend! "
6712472,54349520,2017-03-04T08:53:08Z,"Susan is a lovely host. She has a comfortable flat with clean and spacious rooms, a large bathroom and a nice kitchen. She is very reliable when it comes to planning your journey and communication in advance. A great place for London-visitors!"
6712472,23966375,2017-02-19T10:31:02Z,Susan is a warm and very helpful host.  Recommended. 
6712472,47755450,2017-02-18T10:19:13Z,"Das Haus von Susan ist ein ruhiges Haus. Es herrscht eine angenehme Atmosphäre. Susan vermietet mehrere Zimmer an Gäste, manche sind längere Zeit da. Man kann Susan vertrauen und hat bei ihr die Möglichkeit die Küche zu benutzen. Alles ist sehr angenehm. Die Verkehrsanbindung über die Londoner tube ist auch sehr gut. Die Fahrt ins Zentrum dauert 30 Minuten"
6712472,100650868,2017-02-13T09:42:47Z,"I had a great stay with Susan during my weekend trip to London. Susan is very kind, and I was made to feel right at home. The room was exceptionally clean and very cozy, complete with wifi, TV, guidebooks etc. and with access to a large, very clean bathroom. The house is about a 10-12 minute walk to the nearest tube station and is about a 20-30 minute tube ride to central London depending on what you are looking to do. From Heathrow, the ride in the tube is about 90 minutes to Susan's location. Overall my stay with Susan was lovely, and I would highly recommend the location. "
6712472,2809328,2017-02-08T11:44:45Z,Prima kamer in verrassend grote woning. Je bent wel een uurtje onderweg om in het centrum te komen (lopen naar metro en metro zelf).
6712472,84307618,2017-02-03T09:48:20Z,"Susan is a lovely woman, i felt like at home from the instant i entered the house. She often has several guests. I can only recommend her BnB! "
6712472,25246513,2017-02-01T10:25:12Z,"Susan is the best Airbnb host I've ever had, she's considerate and kind, willing to give advices. Her house is lovely and tidy, fully equipped with facilities. 
Susan是个非常好的房东,房间很舒服宽敞,整座房子舒适而且设备很齐全,Susan很周到也很体贴,有任何需要或者疑问她都能给你建议和帮助。她的房客们来来往往,有机会认识其他地方的来客。Susan喜欢中国,从她家的装饰能看出一二,推荐给大家。"
6712472,52359980,2017-01-26T11:10:00Z,"Was very nice first experience staying in airbnb, clean and comfortable. Classic house style, felt free in the house< like i was in my own home. And 10 mins walk to the subway,  "
6712472,110133684,2017-01-21T08:11:09Z,"I love this place !
Every time again !
"
6712472,474629,2017-01-18T11:33:46Z,"I've always wanted to visit this out-of-the-way part of London, and was fortunate to find a host who goes out of her way for every guest. Susan could not have been more welcoming, accommodating and generous. I left rested, refreshed and well taken care of. Thank you for a fine stay."
817858,48014469,2017-05-08T09:27:07Z,"Cubehouse is a unique experience.
The house is amazing and  cozy.
Good localization,in front of the wonderful Rotterdam market.
Lilian and Mitch are great hosts
There are many good amenities for their guests.
Mitch gave good advises and sugestions
"
817858,69828486,2017-04-30T07:08:24Z,"Our experience in Mitch and Lilian's cube house was truly amazing! We literally didn't want to leave the place after we checked in! We even had to postpone our visit to other places in Rotterdam because we wanted to stay in the house as long as we can.

Mitch and Lilian were so kind and generous that they provided us lots of food and the kitchen were very well equipped and stocked with all the essentials! They also provided us with a huge selections of teas and coffees. We were super impressed.
Much much more than a 5 stars experience!"
817858,17387114,2017-04-29T11:09:19Z,Very unique and enjoyable experience in a clean and spacious apartment! 
817858,122601186,2017-04-28T06:10:58Z,"Mooie woning op een perfecte locatie. Wij hebben genoten van de drukte op Koningsdag in Rotterdam, dat alles op loopafstand is, dat je er lekker moe van werd.... en het feit dat je dan heerlijk je deur dicht kan trekken en een mooi eigen plekje hebt om weer uit te rusten! "
817858,33365670,2017-04-27T06:11:13Z,good
817858,99959771,2017-04-24T08:20:43Z,A very lovely and neat place. Such a wonderful experience in the Cube! 
817858,83627075,2017-04-14T08:55:40Z,"Nice hosts! We checked in late but the hosts left the key for us at the neighbour who was also very friendly and helpful! Convenient location, beautiful and stylish cube house. The kids love it! Definitely will stay again!"
817858,46106986,2017-04-13T03:37:50Z,"The cube house is amazing and spacious,location is very convient to every place,market,tram &  metro is just a few walks away.I really like the top floor with beautiful sunshine."
817858,14801241,2017-04-10T07:19:05Z,"Lilian & Mitch's apartment is very well located to spend a few days in Rotterdam; it is central and close to the public transport (there a very cheap P&R 4 stations away) and from restaurants and city center.
The apartment itself is really original and attracts a lot of attention from tourists as we could judge by the groups walking in Overblaak during our stay; it is perfect for 4 people (we were two adults and two teenagers aged 16 and 14) and we could not recommend enough the top room where you have a wonderful view on Rotterdam and a lot of sun in the evening.
A definitely perfect location in Rotterdam where we would come back with a lot of pleasure."
817858,98244997,2017-04-08T06:47:10Z,"This is in a really great location! We loved being so close to transit and to the Markthal. Lots of great food choices there. We LOVED the Pork Sandwich at De Engel, and the Stroopwafels right next door. A grocery store right in the lower level as well. The only downside is that you are literally staying is a tourist attraction, so there are people outside ALL THE TIME taking pictures and doing tours. Other than that, lots of other positives!"
817858,96560834,2017-04-05T07:56:44Z,"Though we dont met, Mitch had made all the preparation well and good so we checked in without any stress. Out of this staying in a landmark of Rotterdam is worthwhile, the price is little high but when I say landmark this money worth for it. The place looks exactly as in the pictures nothing to reclaim. Will recommend highly if you guys wanna a memory for life. "
817858,51926654,2017-03-28T08:20:31Z,"This home was a wonderful and a special way to experience Rotterdam. Location was great with lots of eating and drinking options. We had our teenage kids with us and having the separate rooms was a nice touch. Beds were comfortable. Getting up the stairs was a little tight, but we also had large bags with us. "
817858,33625346,2017-03-24T09:31:13Z,Best experience I had on Airbnb! Everything was awesome
817858,120326682,2017-03-22T08:52:15Z,"Incredible property in a great location, couldn't ask for a better host. Will definitely be back!"
817858,44046403,2017-03-21T07:45:29Z,"This place was awesome! Located right by the market and indoor market, it was very easy to get around! Be prepared for a lot of stairs to get up, but it is well worth it! "
817858,116060581,2017-03-18T10:33:13Z,"Een keurig en prima appartement. Zeker aan te raden vanwege de bijzondere ligging en erg leuk om een keer in een kubuswoning te kunnen slapen.
Een bijzondere ervaring."
817858,37429287,2017-03-13T08:35:17Z,"Incredible, once-in-a-lifetime sort of stay! Excellent communication, even when I heard a bump in the night that turned out to be nothing. Haha! Mitch took it in stride and assured me that I'd get used to the wild set-up, which I did! Highly recommend. You must stay here!"
817858,96047107,2017-03-09T08:07:04Z,Wonderful house. Especially for the ones interested in architecture. Very close to the market and public transportation. I would recommend this house !!
817858,11331700,2017-03-07T07:33:49Z,"Staying in Lilian & Mitch's place was special, as you're part of something iconic. Rotterdam is all about architecture, and what better way to experience this as by staying in a cubicle house? We loved the top floor, it has some great views and we felt right at home. The location is very central and the hosts were spot-on in their communication & check-in, thanks Lilian & Mitch!"
817858,37238094,2017-03-04T09:56:38Z,"This house is a must and a one in a lifetime experience!
Lilian and Mitch are super responsive and always available!
I would recommend this to everyone!"
953037,62751327,2017-05-12T12:21:10Z,"Stunning villa, really airy and spacious with a lovely sea breeze, very modern kitchen and comfortable beds. The villa is like something out a Hollywood movie! It was very safe and secure in a peaceful location with incredible sea views! Sauna works a treat, and the pool is lovely although the water is a little cold as it's not heated. Can't really fault the place, would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone. The team at Pepe Pisos & Villas were super helpful especially Sam who checked us in. Thanks again :-) "
953037,33507592,2017-05-02T12:16:00Z,Amazing view and easy checkin and checkout. !
953037,18676195,2017-04-26T11:47:02Z,The house is beautiful and the view is magnificent. The kitchen is very well equipped. They were a couple issues but my family and I had a wonderful holiday in this oasis of peace.
953037,6326136,2017-04-06T07:11:07Z,"C'était magnifique,un sans faute pour cette villa de rêve ...tout était parfait,la communication,le logement,la propreté,les équipements,la vue (URL HIDDEN) recommande fortement ce logement,à faire au moins une fois dans sa vie ...aucune surprise à l'arrivée, le logement est entièrement à notre (URL HIDDEN) reviendrais !!! 
A bientot 
Muchas gracias ;)"
953037,16417245,2016-10-19T09:24:11Z,"Es war alles Perfekt!!!
Angefangen von unserem Empfang in der Villa bis hin zur freundlichen und tollen Erklärung des Anwesens.
Die Fotografien des Objekts spiegeln nicht im Ansatz das Erlebnis wieder, wenn sie zum ersten Mal das Haus betreten.
Großartig und atemberaubend, kaum zu glauben welch ein phantastischer Blick einen erwartet.
Jederzeit wieder"
953037,15629718,2016-09-14T06:51:56Z,"It is the most beautiful villa - even better than the photos and with an incredible view out to sea. There is a lovely beach club within walking distance (although we drove as its a long uphill back) where you can have lunch and a short walk along the shore from there, there are some beautiful small beaches. The pool is heaven and we loved sunsets on the deck. As noted, the pool is not heated but we found it the perfect temperature for early September. Would highly recommend it"
953037,81217560,2016-09-09T09:09:18Z,"Beautiful property with stunning sea views especially during sunsets!
The house has a sleek design and offers the essential appliances. It was very clean and welcoming.
The villa is located in a very quite a nice neighbourhood with shops, beaches and beach clubs nearby which was very well appreciated.
However, there were problems with the blinds not working, the inner jacuzzi not emptying, and the washing machine didn't work correctly.
Overall, we had a fabulous stay and would definetly recommend this villa!"
953037,52747726,2016-08-28T04:15:13Z,"The villa is certainly spectacular - when you enter, there are double height ceilings and a fantastic view across the pool and to the sea beyond.  ALso, sun sets across Andratx were very cool.  Pool not heated, but doesn't matter in summer, although autumn bookings should note.  Air con worked well, kitchen (if small) was perfectly equipped and dining facilities were great.  Terrace BBQ got used a lot and very quiet location.
Found the Mhares Beach Club at the bottom of the cliff (able to walk there down stoney rough track) but long uphill walk back.
Only real thing was lack of balustrading - OK as my 3 kids were 15, 13 and 10, but don't go with kids less than 10 years old as 8ft unprotected drop offs from terrace on to pool deck and also unfenced garden on edge of ravine, probably 15 - 20ft drop.  But if older kids, the views are stunning and you will have a great experience."
953037,45704700,2016-08-01T00:47:34Z,"8 great days! House is minimalist in design yet has a nice, set feeling about it. Very well equipped and Rafael w/team were serviceminded and friendly. View is breathtaking and pool wonderful. House can get hot unless one is smart about  actively using persiennas as the sun moves across. Kitchen very well equipped although somewhat small. PS - in spite of sea proximity - this is not a beach property, yet would be pleased to return!"
953037,67290047,2016-06-25T02:15:30Z,"The property is 20 minutes by car without traffic from Palma city even the adress is ""Palma"". We waited at least 30 minutes for the key delivery under the hot sun. The inside of house and view are just ok. The photos on website are much better than reality. When we went in, we found baby bed and baby chair were missing. The owner sent them over late in the evening with a kid food box as gift. We appreciated. The dish washer did not work. Even after the repairation, it did not clean properly. The stove did not work either. The house has only stone stairs and no fences. When you have kids, we do not suggest you rente this property. There is no heating and fence either for the swimming pools, they look nice but are both cold and dangerous for kids. There are ants and clowning insects all over in the house, they even came beside our daughter's pillow! We should have taken some photos of the ants -- they were building nestles 2 places in the house -- a house of ants! There is no restaurants or shops nearby which you could reach by foot. You need to be a good climber to go down hill to the rock beach. Anyway, we could recommend you to try the sea club called ""mhares"" beside the sea, it is 5 minutes by car or 15mintes by foot. The worst, the owner would like to charge us 500 euro and excuse us for having demaged their jacuzzi. To be honest, the drain did not operate the first day when we arrived. We did not use it ever after! "
953037,22929499,2016-06-02T07:56:28Z,"Stunning view, top location, fantastic
house,better than shown on AB&B.
great host, very service orietated.
=> strong recommendstion.
See you again Filipe !"
953037,27871297,2016-05-13T00:24:56Z,"From booking to check in and departure, the service was excellent.  The property was amazing and everything needed for a short trip, better than anticipated.  A fabulous experience, thank you!"
953037,37487487,2015-09-05T13:11:58Z,"Kommunikation mit Rafael ist super schnell und zuverlässig. Hat alles bestens geklappt - total unkompliziert. Wir haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt ! Toller Grill und schöne Küche mit guter Ausstattung ! 
Gerne wieder ! "
953037,269440,2015-08-13T14:47:50Z,"I felt very welcome, the house is beautiful, and facilitated the perfect stay in Mallorca (away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to access everything - i.e. restaurants, sights, markets, etc.).

I cannot say enough about how well stocked the kitchen is! If you like cooking then staying at Rafael's place will be a true joy!"
953037,17403695,2015-07-25T11:51:06Z,"The house is gorgeous with much privacy.  I really can't speak more highly about the house. The location is nice with some ok restaurants and 2 markets (one big and one small) close by.  Palma is close as well. 
There were large mice in the house but we left the doors open a lot because you just want to with view.  
Rafael was not present and we had to figure everything out.  He finally came by to help us with the blinds and the speakers after several days at the villa.  
"
953037,4083261,2015-07-18T13:59:27Z,"This property is just amazing... Due to the nice pictures, we expected a lot but our expectations got exceeded!
The villa, the garden and the pool areas are in a very good condition. You will find everything you need.
Rafael has been a very nice host. He responded to all my messages within minutes and answered every question.
We can highly recommend this accomodation and we are definitely coming back one day!"
953037,15704882,2015-06-17T11:54:11Z,"Die Lage des Hauses ist top. Hoch über dem Meer mit fantastischem Blick. Pool sehr gut zum Schwimmen geeignet und sauberes Wasser. Haus wirkt insgesamt sehr großzügig. Viel Privatsphäre da nahezu uneinsehbar. 4 gute und neue Fahrräder vorhanden. Seine Helme sollte man mitbringen. In der Küche ist alles vorhanden was man so braucht. Ein Leihwagen ist sehr sinnvoll. Man fährt in ca. 20 Min zum Flughafen und in 25 Min in die Stadt. Für Kleinkinder ist das Haus eher nicht geeignet da es viele Bereiche mit Sturzgefahr gibt. Den felsigen Strand erreicht man in ca. 15 Min über einen relativ steilen Geröllweg nach unten. Bitte keinen Sandstrand erwarten. Den gibt es dort unterhalb des Hauses nicht. Bei wenig Wellengang kommt man ganz gut ins Wasser. Der Poolbereich und die Aussicht von oben sind aber so schön dass wir das Meer nicht wirklich vermisst haben. Rafael ist freundlich, kompetent und antwortet rasch und zuverlässig. Wir kommen gerne wieder."
953037,25987308,2015-06-06T11:59:19Z,"Wir sind begeistert von der Unterkunft und vom Gastgeber. Die Kommunikation war extrem schnell und sehr zuverlässig. Und die Übergabe und Abgabe der Unterkunft wurde von Rafael persönlich abgewickelt. Das Haus und vor allem die Location sind aussergewöhnlich. Wir kommen gerne wieder.

"
953037,21694954,2015-05-30T15:16:13Z,I would highly recommend Rafael and his villas.  His service is wonderful and above all else efficient.  He greeted us very late at night / early morning due to our flight.  He had problems fixed within half an hour.  He offered help with late check out and taxis.  Incredible.  The villa is beautiful.  Not the safest  place for children unless you really think your kids will behave and listen.  High drops from the pool.  Cliffside location.  Open staircase.  So definitely no small children.  Best equipped house I've ever seen anywhere in the world other my own home.  And as clean.  This is  how villa rental should be.  
953037,3176375,2015-05-26T15:52:57Z,"Jeff and Raphael were great, amazing views, magnificent villa, perfect location, will definitely stay again!"
1506296,95726906,2017-04-22T07:30:53Z,"We had a great time at Stefanos' place in Imerovigli. The views of the caldera are fantastic and the place is really nice, especially the balcony where you can relax with a glass of wine in the sun. For us, Imerovigli was the perfect place because it was less busy than Fira (15 minute walk) and Oia so you could really relax.

Yannis and Zachos were a great help to us. Yannis gave us lots of recommendations and tips about how to make the most of the stay. When we were confused about which sailing trip to take, he just came round and booked one for us. He really wanted us to enjoy our trip and get good value too.

Zachos was really friendly. He helped us with our luggage and popped in to say hello from time to time. He also took us to the airport when we were leaving to save us getting a taxi. We didn't even have to ask. 

Overall this was a great stay and we would love to go back. "
1506296,33376084,2017-04-15T05:14:13Z,Stunning view and great location. Host was extremely hospitable and would stay again. Perfect place for two!
1506296,106303523,2017-04-14T07:20:49Z,"This place is wonderful! The views cannot be beat, the location is central and very walkable but without the hectic and touristy feel of Fira.  The area is quiet. Maid service daily. If I come back to Santorini I will be staying here again! "
1506296,33477901,2017-04-10T07:30:50Z,This was the perfect choice! We sadly didn't have much time infor Santorini but we couldn't have had a better time than here. Cooking a romantic dinner and having breakfast from the nearby bakery are just some of the perks you get from staying here. Yanis was super nice and helpful. Definitely reccomended! (:
1506296,15852927,2017-04-01T08:50:23Z,"Clean, incredible views, so much value for the price. Would definitely recommend. "
1506296,77330133,2017-03-30T05:12:30Z,
1506296,62024934,2017-03-24T09:12:50Z,A 20 minute walk to the city center. The place is cleaned daily and centered in the middle of a dense residential area. Great views as well. I would recommend. 
1506296,54204333,2017-03-16T08:56:36Z,Yannis and Zachos were amazing.  It was off season but we were well taken care of.  The views were to die for.  My wife and I will definitely be back.  The walk to Fira was short but we were far enough away from the crowds.  There was a pharmacy and market very close by.  The bus stop was right by the road and made it easy to get Oia.Yannis set us up with transport to and from the airport.  The service was impeccable.  Yannis responded to all messages quickly.  This was everything we expected and more.
1506296,92731544,2016-11-12T07:38:18Z,"The apartment is absolutely amazing in every way. It's clean, spacious with fast wifi. It's located right at the cliff of the caldera with breathtaking views (especially the sunset) of the Aegean sea and volcano. We didn't have the pleasure meeting Stefanos. But Yannis and Zachos greeted us at the bus stop and provided the most welcoming and personal services throughout our stay. Yannis was super knowledgeable about the architectural, archaeological and cultural history of Santorini and Greece. His local knowledge has helped us a lot in finding the best places to eat, relax and generally enjoy ourselves. Couldn't say enough good things about this place. We loved it so much and are already planning our next trip to Santorini and Stefanos/Yannis :-) "
1506296,89151633,2016-11-05T08:05:34Z,"Even though we arrived in the morning and too early for check-in, Zachos picked us up from the bus station in Imerovigli and welcomed us warmly. He then showed us to the apartment and stored our luggage until our check-in in the early afternoon. Still in the morning, we were also greeted by Yannis, who informed us about all important sites on the island. 
When we arrived at the apartment for check-in, the apartment was in great shape and very clean, just like on the pictures! Yannis provided us with the keys and all necessary information.
Imerovigli is very beautiful. Since it is located in the island's center, most towns, such as Virostefani and the island's capital Fira, are easily reached by foot and definitely worth a visit. We even took a 2,5 hour hike to Oia, which we definitely recommend doing!
The apartment itself is sweet and beautiful. The view from the balcony is amazing indeed. We enjoyed the view every morning when we had our breakfast on the balcony. So it is definitely worth it!
Since our flight back was late at night, we were once again allowed to store our luggage. Zachos even brought the luggage to the bus station at night.
All in all we had a great and pleasant stay at the apartment!"
1506296,23811505,2016-11-03T07:41:03Z,The view is simply jaw dropping. We felt happiness during our stay at Stephano's home. Yannis and Zackos welcomed us very kindly and took the time to give us lots of information. A living dream... 
1506296,47113726,2016-11-02T07:15:54Z,"Yannis and Zachos were absolutely amazing hosts. They gave us a very comprehensive review of santorini and the things to do around the area. They were very helpful and always available. The apartment itself was amazing and is just as we pictured it. We were able to get some amazing photos too! Thank you so much Yannis and Zachos for everything. I'd highly recommend staying here. Even during November, santorini is still a vibrant and beautiful island."
1506296,26807500,2016-10-28T08:37:16Z,"The place was beautiful, the views stunning, stefanos and his team were a pleasure to deal with and I can't wait to come back on day and stay again. You won't be disappointed. Also we were visited by a very friendly cat...which made the whole thing 10 times better!! "
1506296,80890578,2016-10-23T10:33:40Z,Place was very accurate to what we previously read. Very clean and in a nice location to walk to Fira. Also very easy to get to Oia via the bus. Great stay.
1506296,80890578,2016-10-22T07:17:25Z,"Great location, amazing views and very clean."
1506296,58658096,2016-10-21T03:16:32Z,A great location and unique place that offers peace and quiet at the end of a long day and an amazing view of the Caldera and volcano! There is also some really great restaurants in the area.
1506296,58658096,2016-10-20T06:32:04Z,"Amazing views, nice place, clean and well kept. A great location and some really good restaurants close by. Thumbs up in our books!"
1506296,24149376,2016-10-17T03:12:39Z,Truly one of the most beautiful places we have ever stayed. Everything about this apartment was spot on. Itching to go back already! 
1506296,58674921,2016-10-11T07:52:33Z,"This is a great little studio.
It had everything that we needed but the best part was the fact that the terrace was very private and not overlooked.
Stefanos had arranged for a transfer from the airport which was there when we arrived and we were dropped off at Square Galli where Zachos, Stefanos' assistant was there to meet us.
A wonderful weekend - before we moved to the larger Coco and Belle."
1506296,5371354,2016-10-09T02:44:49Z,"Stefanos had arranged for us to meet Stefanos free we landed at the airport at the imerovigli bus stop, the home is located about a 5 min walk away. Zachos carried our bags down the stairs by himself, very kind of him! Those bags are not light, such a gentlemen. We could not check in until 2pm which was check in time, but Zachos held our bags while we explored. The home is beautiful but I have no words to express how beautiful that view is. I would recommend to watch the sunset from the patio for at least on evening. Rosa came everyday for housekeeping, she was awesome. There are many markets and restaurants within waking distance. We had a great time. Thank you all! "
2532364,17536482,2017-05-11T01:56:30Z,"Great place, very helpful and effortless check in. Place is exactly like the pictures. Mayumi gave us a very warm welcome. Thank you!"

 완벽했다. 벚꽃시즌에 반드시 다시 묵을거에요. 최고의 교토여행을 만들어주어서 감사합니다! "
2532364,25388319,2017-05-05T02:57:16Z,"The house is absolutely lovely and Andrea  is an amazing host. Staying in this typical Japanese house was one the highlight of our travel in Japan. Taking breakfast on the balcony over the river and feeding the ducks had something magic for the kids ... and even the parents! We really hope to come back, and will highly recommend the house to our family and friends. Go for it! "
2532364,56805910,2017-05-03T07:32:06Z,"这是个风景很美的地方,窗外有成片的智樱花树,非常美。"

집안에 필요한 모든것들이 다 있었어요
특히 테라스앞의 사쿠라 최고! 
교토에 온다면 이곳에 머물러보세용"
2532364,59496730,2017-04-26T04:39:46Z,"完美!特别是阳台外面的小溪流,还有株漂亮的樱花树,完美的日式民宿。"
2532364,50511058,2017-04-22T23:55:08Z,"The location of the apartment was so convenient and it was an easy and scenic walk to the shops, restaurants and sights of the Gion/Shijo areas. 

The apartment itself was very comfortable for our family of four (Inc. 2 small children) and was immaculately clean. The little stream that runs past the balcony was so stunning with cherry blossoms in the background and home to ducks and herons who we shared our breakfast with. It was also a nice experience for us to stay in a more traditional Japanese style house - with tatami floors and paper walls. And the mattresses on the floor were super comfortable.

Andrea and Mayumi were such gracious hosts, taking the time to explain the whole apartment to us, as well as giving us really great tips on Kyoto sights, eating out, etc. We barely needed to consult our guidebook after Mayumi took the time to point out everything we needed to know on a map.

What a great base from which to enjoy a beautiful city!"
2532364,57961786,2017-04-18T00:49:23Z,"The hosts are very warm, passionate and helpful. The apartment is cute and well located. True to the description. We had good time staying there. "
2532364,25722890,2017-04-15T02:22:39Z,"We stayed 2 nights in Andrea 's place. It was a wonderful airbnb experience during the stay in Andrea & Mayumi's lovely house. Fast response for every message before / after our booking. Location not hard to find coz the host provided a very clear instruction. Easy to walk to the house whatever you come from Nagoya, Osaka or Kyoto. The house was clean, walkable to the shops & restaurant, very close to the public transportation. Andrea is a very friendly and super nice guy. All of his recommendation is very helpful. My sister and myself are very happy to stay in this lovely place and it definitely one of the best to enjoy cherry blossom spots in Kyoto.  "
2532364,92971541,2017-04-14T01:32:27Z,"非常棒的体验。房屋地理位置绝佳,风景优美,高濑川的清流在阳台下淳淳而过,阳台对过开满了樱花。可爱的小鸭子每天都来报到,你可以坐在阳台上悠闲的喂鸭子,看风景。附近转转,美食购物很方便。离清水寺步行15分钟距离。房东安德烈热情友好,周到好客。谢谢!非常感谢!"
2532364,118359439,2017-04-07T23:42:29Z,"Perfect location, and very good apartment, strongly recommend "
2532364,68323608,2017-04-05T02:37:39Z,"房东很细心很热情,房间里有很多小细节的惊喜,体验了一把暖炉,住得很舒服"
2532364,45725465,2017-04-02T00:47:44Z,"This might be the best place I've stayed at so far while using Airbnb. The place is so nice and comfy and very well designed. Not big, but things are placed where you need them, and all of good quality.
My family's and my favourite part must be the balcony by the river and the ducks waiting for us to feed them. It's a shame that the cherry blossoms haven't bloom while we were there, but beautiful nonetheless.
The host is very friendly and provides a lot of suggestions. Also, the futons and blankets are super comfortable!"
2532364,95835608,2017-03-31T02:00:33Z,We spent 5 days here with our 2 small children here and had a wonderful time. Its a lovely apartment in a nice neighbourhood with everything you need close by. The kids loved feeding the ducks that live in the stream that flows past the balcony and there was a  small playground a few minutes walk away. Andrea and Mayumi were  terrific hosts who went out of their way to help us when we lost a bag in a taxi. I highly recommend this place.
2532364,45988507,2017-01-30T00:57:47Z,"座落在市中心巷弄的日式小屋,可沿路散步到清水寺、錦市場等景點,乾淨舒適有家的溫暖感,特別是早上起床透過陽台著河畔的景色,吃著早餐,幾乎所有我們需要的,Andrea都想到了,特別愛那張暖桌,在寒冬裡特別溫暖!"
2532364,103509820,2017-01-29T00:28:04Z,Andrea waited us to check in and provided Kyoto map and instructions! Very thoughtful! The house was nice and the balcony is brilliant.

3020937,40450281,2017-05-08T20:15:33Z,Sarah was a great host! The cabin was beautiful and located very close to the lake. Special mention to the elaborate guidebook with food recommendations. Highly recommend!  
3020937,26089880,2017-04-30T15:08:29Z,nice cabinet!everything is clean
3020937,106860,2017-04-20T20:22:07Z,"Great location, super clean, and easy. The house was warm and cosy, just was we were looking for. It was hard to leave! :)"
3020937,20698624,2017-04-16T16:25:57Z,This cabin was absolutely delightful and exactly what we wanted for a quiet romantic weekend.  We loved it!
3020937,86501627,2017-04-11T16:57:47Z,"Absolutely perfect! This cabin is everything and more. Sitting on a hill, it gives great views of the outdoors. Not too far from the lake and getting around was easy. Sarah's cabin was beautiful and fit 6 adults (3 couples) perfectly. The cabin is decorated flawlessly and feels brand new. The stay was just as described from Sarah. We will be coming back! "
3020937,4358448,2017-03-30T15:54:54Z,"What a great cabin this is! Close to ski resorts, fully equipped kitchen, lovely decor, super clean...
We would love to stay again!
"
3020937,11544980,2017-03-26T16:58:10Z,"We went on a spring skiing trip in Tahoe and Sarah's place was perfect! Cozy, beautifully decorated, comfortable beds and space. We had a fantastic time!"
3020937,81757184,2017-03-17T18:21:01Z,"I highly recommend this cabin! It was in a beautiful, quiet location close to the lake. It is great for families or multiple friends. We hope to stay here again- this time to see Tahoe in the summer!"
3020937,5223448,2017-03-05T16:59:45Z,"Sarah's place was perfect! We had 2 couples use the listing for a weekend ski trip in Tahoe and enjoyed coming home to such a cozy place after a long day on the mountain. The living room was great to sit, chat, and eat together while watching the snow pile up outside the window. Would definitley recommend folks to stay here. "
3020937,12033041,2017-02-27T17:52:32Z,"This is the most adorable cabin that's the perfect size for a small group.  The deck was completely filled with snow so we couldn't go out there, but from the cabin windows we can see the sparkling water of Lake Tahoe just between the snow covered trees, and it made for an absolute magical stay.  The cabin was just off the main road, but you couldn't tell because it was quiet and felt secluded.  And with the cabin being in between Northstar and Squaw (if you ski/snowboard,) getting to either resort is quick and straight forward. 

The kitchen is well equipped with everything you'll need to cook up a nice meal.  The bedrooms had plenty of pillows and blankets for those cold nights, and the living room had very comfortable couches and chairs perfect for just lounging around.

Sarah, the host, was traveling internationally but still made sure we had all the information we needed for a seamless check-in, and left information for another contact person in case we needed help.

My friends and I have stayed in various cabins in south and north Tahoe, and this has been by far one of our favorites.  We would love to come back here in the summer!"
3020937,20874769,2017-02-25T17:40:55Z,"We loved our week-long stay this beautiful and super comfortable cabin.  If ever there was a cabin to be snowbound in, this is it.  In addition, the internet and cable connection was outstanding (no interruption in a severe snowstorm).  "
3020937,111683804,2017-02-18T19:45:44Z,"Sarah's place is a beautifully remodeled, decorated and maintained cabin, in a convenient location. She was great about communicating and ensuring a comfortable stay. You cannot go wrong. Thank you Sarah!"
3020937,10713783,2017-02-06T16:37:03Z,The place was exactly as advertised. Very cozy. We had a great time. Would stay here again. 
3020937,56360728,2017-01-25T16:17:59Z,"The cabin is beautiful, very tasteful and intimate with great views surrounded by trees and the lake. Filled with everything you need this was the perfect getaway to the snow. Would love to stay again."
3020937,102502010,2017-01-23T18:26:50Z,"This adorable little cabin was everything we were looking for. There were four of us, and each couple stayed in a room and chose their own bathroom. The kitchen being fully stocked was a huge help, and helped us eat more cooked meals rather than eating out every meal. During dinner we realized we forgot something, but being so close to shops and stores made it so easy to venture out and pick up what we needed. Although we never had to contact Sarah during our stay, she made herself very reachable and personable. Overall, this adorable, cozy cabin was everything we were looking for, and really made our trip the best experience. Hoping to be back once warmer weather hits, that way we can use the gorgeous deck we seen in pictures. :)"
3020937,49589902,2017-01-16T18:12:15Z,"Sarah is definitely a SUPER HOST! One of the things I pay particular attention to in booking on Airbnb is the responsiveness of the host, and let me tell you - Sarah was quick to follow up on my questions/inquiries and extremely accommodating with our group.
The cabin is as lovely as pictured, and was comfortable for all of our guests. She also provided very nice amenities, including a well-stocked kitchen so we were able to make breakfast and dinner during our entire stay, without having to bring all of our own equipment. 
As far as location goes, the cabin itself was situated in a quiet neighborhood not too far from a main shopping center. We came right after a snow storm so it was a bit difficult to navigate through the neighborhood, but I imagine it would be very nice easy to find the driveway during other seasons ;) All in all, we had a wonderful stay there."
3020937,93251305,2017-01-10T18:52:39Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage. It was everything as described & everything we needed was provided. 
Our tip is if you visit in winter come in a 4 wheel drive. There was 5 ft of snow before we arrived & then a blizzard on the day we left so the 4 wheel drive was a must to be able to get out"
3020937,51435246,2017-01-07T01:26:32Z,"We stayed at Sarah and Nick's place during Snowpocalypse 2017. It was a winter wonderland. We were not able to do everything we wanted to, but really enjoyed snowshoeing in the neighborhood. The cabin was well appointed and a great place to be holed up. We had a great time in spite of everything, and hope to go back at some point!  Thanks Sarah and Nick!"
3020937,32973541,2017-01-02T03:51:56Z,Beautiful and cozy cabin. Great location and  accurate description of house. Sarah is a wonderful host. Highly recommended!
3020937,2988180,2016-12-29T01:53:40Z,"We loved everything about this cabin! Sarah & Nick were so lovely to deal with and any questions we had were promptly answered. 

We spent a gorgeous white Christmas here with friends (4 adults for a week in total) and it was perfect - warm, cosy and fun. Everything you want and need is in this cabin including lovely beds, linen and towels but that's not what we loved most. What we really loved was the atmosphere. With gorgeous detail Sarah and Nick have made a beautiful home away from home where you can rest, relax and just be. 

With a great little kitchen that was well stocked with all the bits and bobs we needed, we prepared a full Christmas banquet over the course of 2 days. With a great supermarket up the road we could pick up anything we had forgotten for festive eating and drinking. With the guidance of super friendly neighbours we were able to enjoy a sled before breakfast on Christmas Day (our first time ever). We took advantage of the easy access that Sarah & Nick have to the glorious lake with leisurely strolls to work off all the festive indulgence and admire the stunning views from the private pier. We curled up the day after with movies as we watched the snow outside by the log fire. And to cap it all off, just a short drive away were the lovely lodges of Northstar where we could watch the world go by, ice skate, ski and fill our tummies again with more delicious treats. We loved our stay so much and all wished we could have stayed for longer. It turned out to be perfect! Thank you again."
1984135,90666890,2017-04-29T08:53:24Z,"Thierry and Romeo were very kind hosts, they were gone most of the day so we were alone there much of the time we were there. They were very helpful in showing us the metro station and how to get around Paris. The apartment was lovely and very clean. "
1984135,4162114,2017-04-15T06:30:42Z,"Thierry was one of the most responsive hosts I have had the chance to meet on AirBnB so far. All communication was perfect and the check-in was seamless. I would recommend staying here, especially if you have a keen eye for design and decor. Quintessential Parisian apartment with a very generous and kind host! "
1984135,89939005,2017-03-16T07:05:49Z,"The apartment is beautiful! Exactly like the pictures in every way. The art is phenomenal. The location is great, near many shops and restaurants. Not very touristy either which is something I appreciate. Thierry was a great host. We couldn't figure out how to open the door and had to unfortunately wake him in the night, but he was understanding. The door is a different lock style than American doors, so be sure to practice this! We used his recommendations for restaurants, all of which were great. He was more than willing to help you find places and how to get there. Overall a fantastic stay. "
1984135,101484806,2017-03-06T09:40:56Z,"Thierry was a great host, he picked us up at the metro and showed us around...he and his partner were really considerate so we felt like we had the place for ourselves."
1984135,50697209,2017-02-18T07:48:33Z,"Thierry and Romeo were the most lovely hosts, always smiling and very hospitable. For a first time in Paris, the time we spent at Thierry and Romeo's place made us feel like home. They are welcoming and the apartment was beautiful, in every sense the Parisian home. I would recommend Thierry and Romeo's home in a heart beat! Thank you to both of you. "
1984135,47532202,2017-02-09T09:33:18Z,"Very very cool place 
Thierry and Romeo are very kind and good people. 
he also recommended tourist attractions by map.
The house was very nice and I wish I could see them again.
Thanks!!!!! Thierry & Romeo 
"
1984135,44037670,2016-10-21T02:06:13Z,"Thierry was a terrific host. Even though this was an apartment share, it was like we were there alone.  Thierry gave us great instructions & tips to get around Paris to see as much as we could in 3 days. His apartment is clean and perfectly located from sightseeing. We would love to stay there again if we are so lucky to get back to Beautiful Paris "
1984135,1844190,2016-09-26T01:01:12Z,"My husband and I stayed in Thierry's home for 7 days. Our stay was awesome! Thierry is such a great help with showing you around the neighborhood. The area is filled with local bars and restaurants where we had a great time. He is accomodating to anything you may need during your stay. There when you need him, and he gives you enough privacy. Thank you so much Thierry! I highly recommend his place."
1984135,52089334,2016-05-27T02:51:33Z,"Very nice, clean and cosy apartment - looks exactly the same as in the pictures. The flat is in a great location. Thierry was a great host, kind and helpful. I can highly recommend a stay in this beautiful apartment."
1984135,9076121,2016-05-14T03:20:11Z,"Thierry and Gali were fantastic hosts of a fantastic apartment in perhaps the most vibrant area of Paris. They were both very welcoming, fun, sociable and interesting hosts with great suggestions for the area. In terms of the apartment - it looks exactly as it does in the photos (Thierry has great taste in art and decor) and is a beautiful place of respite within the busy city. Because the area is so vibrant, there are cafes in nearly every corner of the nearby streets, and you are just a 10 minute walk from the Canal Saint Martin, 5 minutes from the Metro, and 5 minutes to Republique. 

Thierry and Gali represent what is truly great about the Airbnb experience - great people with great insight that are willing to share a bit of their city with those traveling through. Thanks for everything Thierry & Gali, I look forward to staying with you again in the future!"
1984135,55209296,2016-04-29T00:52:03Z,Beautiful apartment with best location in the city of Paris. Only 5 mins walking distance to Metro. Fast WiFi speed! Very wonderful place for a short stay!

The 10th arrondissement is beautiful and very lively with a lot of nice cafés and shops. It is very central, we used the metro maybe 4 times in the 5 days we were there. You can walk to Marais or the Seine in around 30 minutes and can reach Montmartre in 25 minutes. There is also a metro station nearby. Thierry provided us with maps and books about Paris and was very nice. We could use the kitchen, which had almost everything you need in order to cook.  
We will surely try and get the same apartment again should we go to Paris again. "

1984135,5488987,2016-04-11T11:14:35Z,"Such a beautiful apartment. In a great and lively part of Paris. And Thierry and Gali couldn't be sweeter. I'm so happy we chose to stay here. 
I love hearing the children going to school in the morning, eating at so many amazing neighborhood cafes, and being 2 blocks from the #4 Metro line. So easy to go anywhere, including the airport. Thank you!"

8608503,25253644,2017-03-30T03:17:16Z,"很好的房子,室内装饰一级棒,就是床有点儿高,降低十公分就完美了。
小花园非常赞,入住后孩子天天给花浇水,走的时候还哭了,舍不得那些花。地理位置不错,离地铁步行略远,适合喜欢散步的人们。
出门右转的胡记锅贴一级棒,吃早点的好去处。
除了南边的肇嘉浜路比较宽,周边马路都是单行线,老上海的情调浓浓的,大爱。
晚上马上车声略吵,但不影响睡眠。
推荐!"

8608503,9916609,2017-03-26T02:28:16Z,"Beautifully decorated traditional laneway house in great location! Our host was very easy to communicate with, connected with us via we chat straight after booking with the address and detailed instructions for how to access the flat. 

Unfortunately, a few hiccups with checking in. We asked if we could drop our bags off at 1pm. Our host agreed, but we couldn't actually check in until 3pm as the flat needed to be cleaned. We ended up arriving around 3pm anyway but found that the cleaner was still there, and didn't finish until almost quarter to 4. This was annoying as we were extremely jet lagged and were hoping to get some rest before dinner. The bedsheets had also not been dried properly due to the lack of time so they were still damp on the bed for the first night.

One thing that bothered us was although the garden gate locked, we couldn't lock the front door of the actual house. Not sure if it was maybe broken but we felt a bit insecure leaving the house! Luckily nothing happened but people could easily hop over the fence and break in. "
8608503,54040789,2017-03-21T00:52:23Z,"首先,必须讲,跟闺密一起住,我们都非常喜欢这里。尤其下雨的时候,隔着落地玻璃听雨声。看之前有人讲会有些味道,味道这件事客观讲应该是老式房子的缘故,洗手间窗户不开的话会有些许。不过没有严重到影响居住,只是对气味比较敏感的人会感觉到。但是相比于房子的整体度,是可以忽略不计的。提醒大家的是,房子周围马路多数为单行道,打车过去的话多看看地图。距离地铁站都很近,五六分钟的路程。周围有很多可以吃饭的地方,本帮菜馆和日料,西餐,都很突出。总之非常值得一住。"

1697780,6340689,2017-04-25T04:04:23Z,"Great apt situated in Chinatown 2 min away by tuk tuk from MRT station Hua Lampong taking you to center, Asok/Sukhumvit. The location is quiet in a small alley with a roaster waking you up everyday like if you were in the countryside! Chinatown is a great neighborhood with many antiques and jewelry stores as well as great food. Thomas is nice and helpful. Great experience overall."
1697780,1173091,2017-04-19T01:34:14Z,"We spent 3 months in Thomas' apartment. It is located in a hip residential neighborhood; there are many cool restaurants, bars, art galleries, tattoo parlors, etc., within walking distance but also great old-school street vendors and shophouses. The closest MRT station is a 10- to 15-minute walk, or you can pick up the river ferry just 5 minutes away. The neighbors are super-friendly and you can meet artists through the gallery downstairs. Thomas was a great host: Very responsive, even while traveling abroad, and quick to fix any issues. The apartment is handsomely decorated and HUGE by Bangkok standards; cool industrial vibes, loads of natural light, etc. There are three A/Cs and a small porch with plants, but we didn't sit outside because it was always too hot. Thomas allowed us to bring our two Chihuahuas, which we really appreciated (it's hard to find pet-friendly housing in BKK). The kitchen is very large and decently equipped for cooking. The shower is also large and stays hot. The bed is very comfortable and there is a giant closet for storage. The internet was mostly consistent. Thomas sent in a housekeeper once a week to change sheets and towels and clean up; her name is P'Nuk and she's awesome! You'll see her around a lot. FYI, the gallery downstairs often hosts opening and closing parties, so expect some late-night noise. Overall, we definitely recommend this neighborhood, this apartment, and this host!  "
1697780,1890149,2017-01-19T01:57:21Z,The flat is spacious and very unique and also centrally located in a very nice and original neighbourhood. To stay there was one of the best eyperiences on our Thailand trip. Definitely recommended!
1697780,48677114,2017-01-15T02:41:39Z,"Beautiful and unique apartment in a convenient location right next to a river taxi stop.  Art gallery downstairs will likely have a good vibe when it's a bit more renovated, but for now looks like it's under construction with workmen around (you have to walk through to get to the apartment).  Our only concern was that the apartment doesn't really have locks - it can only lock from the inside with a pretty flimsy latch so when I arrived late at night before the bf it was a bit unnerving staying there alone.  Other than that it was a lovely stay and Thomas was a great host. "
1697780,11521969,2017-01-10T02:02:10Z,Thomas was very nice and finding the apartment in the middle of busy Bangkok was surprisingly smooth. Location was good and apartment was hip and interesting. The downfall was that it was very loud outside and I am not talking about street noise. There was a concert that played 20 hrs non stop right downstairs and it was very loud that we couldn't sleep or even hang out in the flat. Also having some curtains in the flat would have been nice. Again Thomas was awesome but the circumstances around the flat were unfortunate. 
1697780,11326957,2017-01-05T04:43:22Z,"Excellent from start to finish. Thomas was a great host and the space was amazing, very modern and unique. Would definitely stay again. "
1697780,21112152,2017-01-04T07:58:19Z,"This was our first trip to Bangkok and we loved it, in large part thanks to Thomas and his fantastic apartment. You could not ask for a better host. Thomas met us when we arrived, showed us the apartment and was always available for tips on things to do in the area and to help out with the few questions that came up. The apartment itself is super spacious, more spacious than we'd envisioned from the photos. The bed is king-sized, comfortable and separate from the rest of the space with its own AC unit, so the bedroom cooled down nicely and made sleeping easy. The location itself is quiet and charming. It's also super close to the river and a 10 minute walk to the metro station. Lots of Bangkok is really commercial, and we loved feeling a bit removed from all of that but still able to access it when we wanted. Highly recommend!"
1697780,20143775,2016-12-26T03:52:17Z,"Great place, good location"
1697780,1126851,2016-12-15T02:40:31Z,"Thomas's place was unique for Bangkok, a lot of the other places we looked at were in hi rises and looked the same. This one is different, it's a very cool, meticulously designed cement open plan apartment. It's also great in a nice little creative enclave thats close to everything. "
1697780,2630588,2016-12-10T03:51:24Z,"Casa meravigliosa, posizione molto comoda è vicina alle principali attrazioni e vita notturna. Host molto accogliente e disponibile"
1697780,5803617,2016-12-03T03:07:11Z,"I stayed here for 5 weeks - it was a great place to base myself as I settled into BKK. The local neighbourhood is exactly that, local. It feels like you're part of a community and the people really do watch out for one another. 

I really enjoyed the location - it was less than 10 minutes by cab to the nearest BTS station at a cost of about THB 50-60 (SGD $2) which made it easy to get around. Plus, being close to the river, suddenly opened up all sorts of options. 

The property itself is cool; the kind of place I would have loved through my 20s and 30s with all it's concrete. In my 40s I was incredibly comfortable, was able to cook, and really enjoyed the sense of space. Open up the windows and the doors to both of the balconies and you get this lovely cross-wind which helps keep the place nice and cool. 

The pictures are an accurate representation of the property, well decorated, well lit, great sense of space. 

This place isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for something really different, offers a strong local feel and somewhere to hide away from the world when you need it, this is the place for you. 

Stongly recommended. If I hadn't just moved to BKK, I'd definitely stay here again. "
1697780,3028991,2016-10-30T11:47:43Z,"This is a very unique and personal place to stay in Bangkok. Great location, kool vibe, lots of options to go. China Town is not far either. Or you grab a boat nearby to go up further into Old Town. - Thomas was a very helpful host, fast with his replies. - Highly recommended."
1697780,14306833,2016-10-18T01:35:07Z,"The communication with Thomas was quick and clear. Thomas was very helpful during our stay and gave us a lot of recommendations on the places to visit. The loft was beautifully furnished and decorated, every single space in the listing is Instagram-worthy. Highly recommend this place to travelers that want a different experience in Bangkok!"
1697780,40135001,2016-10-09T03:28:47Z,Thomas's loft was spacious and simply spectacular with his own plenty of artworks and collectibles showcased and also his art gallery is right downstairs. Definitely one of the most unique and hip Airbnb experiences one can ever ask for!
1697780,33170289,2016-10-03T03:24:35Z,"Very stylish room and we enjoyed the stay. It's located on the third floor of an old building in an old quarter near the river. The first floor of the building is a modern gallery. Clean and Thomas is really a nice landlord, picking up us at Sheraton and showed us the way. The only flaw is privacy… many trees are planted on the balcony or outside the window but it's still a concern. "
1697780,7148631,2016-09-28T02:52:44Z,"Beautiful, beautiful place. Thomas was a really friendly and helpful host! His workers stay downstairs but they are Super nice and easy going. It's a bit of a walk in though, so be sure to drop a pin on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps if you're not good with directions! :) "
1697780,32262100,2016-09-18T03:58:09Z,"环境挺好的,不过没见到房东,是房东的女仆来接我们的房子在老城区,一楼是咖啡厅,二楼是画展,三楼是住宿的地方,抬行李有点费劲不过没关系哈哈,第一个晚上没水了,等到早上起来才洗澡的,第二个晚上也有水了,房东也很热心解决问题。"
1697780,7837591,2016-09-17T02:26:37Z,"Although Thomas was back in his home country during our stay, his helper P Nok was more than helpful to fetch us from the meeting point. "
1697780,1518246,2016-09-13T01:50:04Z,"Thomas has a beautiful, well maintained flat that is located in a quiet neighborhood by the Chao Phraya river -- with easy access to the mall, coffee shops, convenience stores, a drug store, and a small local eatery serving lovely Thai food. I will definitely get in touch with him the next time I'm in Bangkok to arrange to stay in his flat again :-)"

369034,121309193,2017-04-09T07:11:54Z,"Vicky's place is really cosy. Everything was perfect from communication to arrival and instructions. We got a (unexpected) breakfast, so that's also really nice. We met Vicky as a warm, friendly and funny person. 
Our stay couldn't have been better!"
369034,96294742,2017-04-04T07:23:48Z,"Vicky's place is very nice, comfortable and decorative, she has its own style of design, and the place is almost the same in what you find in the photos. I like the beautiful flowers put in our bedroom and kitchen too. 

Her place  is located in London zone 2 area, so quite good a location to go to Central London. 

Her home is near to Baron's court underground station (5 to 8 mins walk) which is very good.  But one thing at night time is a bit of walking distance and also need to pass through some quiet places when walk back home in the night time from both Barons court or Hammersmith station (12 to 15 mins walk), as the quickest way of Baron's court is being closed in the evening time, so need to walk a bit further more.  

Vicky is a very good and nice host,  quite helpful and detailed minded, she will provide you many information before your trip and also caring for us attentively. 
However,  we have not much time to meet each other as she is also out for vacation a few days during our 6 days stay , otherwise I think we can talk to each other a lot. 

Thanks Vicky"
369034,112269610,2017-03-28T09:16:20Z,"A modern, safe, comfortable, and conveniently located place to stay with a hostess who made us feel at home with her clean home, tasty breakfast foods, and tea. She offered just the right balance of privacy and engaging conversation. I knew I would adore Vicky the moment I waked in and saw art by Banksy! An intelligent, thoughtful, and tidy hostess who was very generous and also knowledgeable about where to eat - Thanks Vicky, Poppies Thai food was like Alice In Wonderland with Great Thai food! The near by cemetery and quick walk to Barons Court Station made this an easy stay. Also, there are some great shops right near by if one is keen to do some shopping for groceries, fashion clothing, stationary, you name it. This area was safe to stroll in, so bring your walking shoes. Our favorite near-by museum to visit was the house of the famous Pre-Raphielate Brotherhood Artist Sir Frederick Leighton. This was a real treasure and only a 25 minute stroll from Vicki's with lots to see on the way. We hope to see Vicky again, ~ Cheers! "
369034,113668282,2017-03-26T07:38:42Z,Vicky is great. It was nice and clean and she even left a list of things to do around town. 
369034,56841944,2017-03-10T11:14:59Z,Vicky's house is cozy and quiet. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with lovely bedding. The bathroom is modern.  Short walk from Barons Court tube. Vicky was an accommodating host and very easy to communicate with. Highly recommend.

Le dépôt de bagages le jour de notre arrivée ainsi qu'avant notre départ facilite le séjour.
Logement situé sur la zone 2 du métro, sur la Picadilly Line est idéal pour visiter Londres et payer moins cher de métro.
Merci encore pour tout Vicky."
369034,13617486,2017-02-07T08:52:10Z,"Vicky is a friendly, welcoming, and communicative host. Her place is cozy, clean, and well appointed.

369034,95098942,2017-01-19T11:44:20Z,Our stay at Vicky's was everything we had been hoping for and the short walk to the bus and underground was perfect for getting around to see the sights of London.

369034,80425529,2016-12-20T05:34:36Z,"Vicky was an extremely welcoming host in her beautiful home. The room was gorgeous, clean and warm as was the private bathroom. Vicky was very flexible and understanding of the long 13+hour days of working I had and staying with her definitely made the week at Olympia London International Horse Show mych, much easier to endure! I recommend Vicky as a host in the highest terms."
369034,9205521,2016-11-30T09:18:12Z,We loved Vicky’s place!  We extended our stay for another few days.  The location is perfect near the tube and the river walk.  Vicky was easy to work with and was always there when we had questions or needed help.  I would definitely book Vicky’s place again. 
369034,9205521,2016-11-27T11:47:51Z,"Vicky’s place was cozy and a perfect fit for us with two separate bedrooms.  The locations is great; very close to the river to enjoy some beautiful walks along the Thames and about 5 minutes from the Baron’s court tube station or 10 minutes from Hammersmith station.  Vicky has been great at communicating everything we need to know and even went out of her way with extra breakfast food, coffee, tea, etc..  We have had a lovely visit.  I would definitely book Vicky’s flat again!"
369034,17507422,2016-11-20T10:14:28Z,"Vicky is a kind individual, had a great time talking to her and her home was lovely & decently close to two prominent tube stations. Would recommend! "

8728954,106023786,2017-05-09T06:15:31Z,"今天离开大理来香格里拉,因为一个客栈还有点恋恋不舍没有入住的时候加了(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN),咨询从机场去的路线,特别细致有耐心,以为是个妹子,到了发现是三个汉子。
楼顶的星空房是天台的玻璃隔间,整个天台就像被我们承包了一样,这个天台应该是附近最高的一个了,客栈里有八只超萌的喵星人,到了的第一天就一直在撸猫,看云彩,在天台上支了三脚架拍延时的云涌、日出、日落,苍山洱海都在眼底(洱海略远,只能看到一点)。
距离大理古城的洱海门(东门)很近,两三分钟就到了,东门里是古城里比较“小资”或者说“文艺”的地方了,北门和西门属于原住民的生活区,南门附近更像一个哪里都有的一条旅游购物街。
我们有早餐券,所以早上都在客栈解决了,两种套餐都尝试过以后,比较推荐米线套餐。
要注意的是,星空房没有单独的卫生间,要去三楼的卫生间,不过很干净,而且设施比较齐全,用起来很舒服。
客栈的小哥们还替我们定了去香格里拉的客车票,特别热情,感动坏了。
另,打碎了一个玻璃杯子,小哥说不用赔,没事弄得还挺不好意思,谢谢啦。
总的来说还是很推荐的,希望你们能在大理玩的开心。"
8728954,84172945,2017-05-05T08:33:35Z,"天台有8只猫猫!太可爱 太温馨了。星空房白天会有点热,所以还是在外面玩好。酒店在古城,晚上玩的吃的很多。"
8728954,55350061,2017-05-01T03:43:47Z,"The staff here are super welcoming, and the star room is lovely, indeed, without a bathroom is a bit suffering at night, while the roof top is quite like the extension of our little glass room. And the location is quite close to the old town, like 2 mins walk. And it also has a pretty petit garden to dine in. A very nice stay in Dali."
8728954,118614696,2017-04-27T02:22:16Z,"长途跋涉后看到酒店的时候内心是奔溃的,因为太美好了,好到不真实!帅哥老板在天台筑了个梦,我不想醒"
8728954,114789001,2017-04-21T02:47:05Z,好
8728954,121495013,2017-04-19T07:27:31Z,"星空房除了没有卫生间不方便以外,其他都很棒,不喜欢喵星人的可能要考虑多一点,因为天气好的时候楼台上都是睡懒觉的喵星人~"

本来以为小房间,会生活的不太方便,但是里面的设备一应俱全还有很多细节问题老板也考虑到了。洗澡上厕所需要下一层楼但是很干净很方便,"

534069,54658117,2017-04-28T08:39:09Z,"Terese's home in San Sebastián is as stated in the heart of Old Town. Everything is just outside your door. Her home is a large beautifully designed loft. Well appointed, comfortable, with everything you need for a short or long stay. As hosts, Terese and Luis were very responsive and easy to communicate with. They told us everything we needed to know to have a great stay. It would be hard to find better hosts and a great place to stay in San Sebastián. "

From making sure our baby had a suitable crib to sleep in to making wonderful suggestions on where to eat.  We loved the location and our little baby loved running around the apartment.  (Only comment for those with kids/toddlers/babies - not necessarily kid friendly - lots of glass tables and breakable items where babies can easily reach... but a couple of minutes of just moving some items out of the way and watching the little ones, we were good to go)  The biggest concern were the glass tables, but our little one didn't run into them (thank goodness!).  Beautiful space and amazing location!! Thanks again for a lovely stay."
534069,17772782,2017-04-04T07:25:59Z,This flat is probably one of my favorite ones to date. Fabulous location with amazing decor. There is a lift that is extremely helpful with your luggage. I was greeted with a bottle of wine & given helpful suggestions to viewing the city. Wonderful hosts for an incredible destination. 
534069,267139,2017-04-02T09:34:39Z,"We cant say enough good things about Terese and Luis...The flat is just great and there is no better location in San Sebastian. Follow their recommended pinxtos tour and you will not be sorry. If you drive, park in Okendo parking...just 5 minute walk to the flat. There is a lift, so no carrying bags, despite the beauty of the old building. Luis should be the mayor of san sebastian. He knows everything about the city. Our only regret was not staying longer."
534069,96198379,2017-03-29T09:16:25Z,Just perfect. Can't wait to return!!
534069,42177595,2017-03-25T09:35:30Z,"After a slightly awkward experience with our last Airbnb experience in Spain, we were a bit reluctant to book a flat in San Sebastian, especially for a week. However, we needn’t have worried because Luis and Teresa were fantastic hosts from the outset. Ahead of our stay, they sent over plenty of tips on their favourite restaurants, bars and things to do in the city. Our flight arrived early, but we were barely waiting a few minutes before being shown around the flat and given even more recommendations (and kindly welcomed with a bottle of wine – thanks again!). The flat itself is modern, bright and clean, and looks just like in the photos. It’s located on one of the main streets in the Old Town, but you wouldn’t know it when you’re inside because it faces away from the street and is therefore really quiet; perfect for light sleepers. Plenty of cutlery, crockery, pots and pans and spices are provided if you want to cook, or just enjoy a lazy breakfast at the flat on some days like we did. 

We tried most of their recommended pintxos bars and loved La Cuchara (foie gras, suckling pig), Bar Nestor (the freshest tomato salad and infamous tortilla), Atari (amazing octopus), Sirimiri (modern pintxos and creative small plates), Bar Antonio (oxtail ravioli) and Zazpi (beef cheek). It’s impossible to get a taste of all of the bars, even in one week, despite our best efforts! As for the high-end restaurants, Kokotxa near Santa Maria Church is a nice option if you want to sample elevated cuisine without breaking the bank. The other well-known restaurants are all located a short taxi ride from San Sebastian.

Luis and Teresa also encouraged us to see the sights on foot, including a 10k hike to a small fishing village called Pasia. There, we tucked into some fresh fish at Casa Camara with French flavours.

If you’re visiting this city, this really is the best place to experience it. You can’t get a more central location in the heart of the Old Town action, a more spacious and well kitted out flat or nicer hosts!"
534069,24545128,2017-03-18T09:59:35Z,"We can't praise our experience in San Sebastian enough! A fantastic, chic & extremely comfortable apartment in the perfect location! As others have said, the recommendations for places to eat, walks & excursions by Luis were spot on. 
This apartment puts you right in the  heart of the old town, easily walkable to all highlights... but has a sense of calm & tranquillity about it.
Communication was easy & I had a response within minutes of my many questions. 
I would happily recommend this to everyone wanting an authentic experience with charming hosts!
Thank you!

La ubicación es realmente buena; esta todo a un paso y la zona está plagada de bares y restaurantes para probar los mejores pintxos.
La decoración es como se ve en la fotos; muy chula. Y el apartamento tiene todo lo necesario: gel, champú, toallas, sábanas, capsulas de cafe, cosas para el desayuno, aceite, sal...

534069,4748514,2017-02-18T09:58:43Z,"This is an apartment that looks spectacular, just like the photos. It's comfy, and surprisingly quiet given its central location. Perhaps this is helped by the fact it's at the back of the building which means both that there's not much of a view (though you can see the castle above the retaining wall), but also that it's not overlooked. It really is so convenient for everything in the old town. I enjoyed my stay very much, and a special thank you to Luis who sorted a problem when I list my keys with considerable grace and efficiency. Itziaa, who checked me in and delivered a spare set of keys, was absolutely lovely, spoke excellent English, and very helpful. All in all a very good experience. "

The apartment is amazing and located right in the middle of everything. It is clean, quiet and cosy and beautifully decorated.

Luis, who welcomed us was a perfect host. He habe us recommendations where to go, what places to see and what restaurant, tapas and pintxos bars to try out. We had a perfect stay and would definitely come back. Thank you so much! Best regards. "

We would definately recommend this place. "
943864,32615872,2017-04-23T07:41:15Z,Beautiful trulli home. About 30 minutes from the famous trulli village. House is smaller than pics made it appear but it's lovely and a good location to explore the area. Host was wonderful and very welcoming. Thank you for having us! 
943864,13258415,2017-04-20T01:34:32Z,"Sehr liebevoll gestaltetes Ferienhaus; klein aber fein, für uns fünf vollkommen ausreichend.

943864,17630594,2017-04-12T02:44:44Z,"A lovely truly, beautifully decorated . Very quiet location - You do need a car although we enjoyed walking to the supermarket near the station, about a 15 minute walk through beautiful countryside.
Trollo is ideal for a family of 4. Our teenagers particularly enjoyed the cats and the decent wifi.
Biaggo was very helpful.
Grazie per tutti !"
943864,9324091,2017-04-09T02:21:07Z,"The trulli house was exceptional in every way; location, facilities, and our first experience into life in Puglia.  Communications before and during our stay were fast and really appreciated recommendations and advice when we needed it throughout the week.  Check in was seemless!  Loved our week and would thoroughly recommend staying at Biagio's house.  Trips from the trulli included highlights of Locorotonda, Aberobella and Madera Bike Tour.  Awesome experiences :)"
943864,93863946,2017-03-30T08:26:48Z,"What a lovely little break!!

Biagio, Mima and Luca have done a lovely job renovating the Trullo. From first contacting Luca on Air BnB to Biagio collecting us from the airport the Guarini family were friendly and ran an efficient operation! 

We paid for Biagio and his friend Giuseppe to pick us from the airport for our five person party. They were there prompt, on time and waiting for us in the arrival hall. When we got to the trullo, Mima had prepared us a wonderful delicious cold meal spread. It included a selection of cheeses, cold meats, bread, cooked aubergines and artichokes as well as an artichoke tart, mince stuffed aubergines and more than enough local wine. However the star of the show was her Apple Cake. 

Biagio and Luca had also arranged for us to hire a car which they had waiting outside the trullo when we got there! Biagio is a charming man and was more than helpful explaining how the pellet fire worked and Mima gave us the thorough lowdown of our meal and how all the kitchen appliances worked. 

The trullo is well placed to visit the towns of Alberobello, Ostuni and Martina Franca and we made it to the beach at poligano a mare, the harbour of monopoli and the casttelana caves quite easily despite a few wrong turns on the unfamiliar Italian roads! It is worth noting you do need a car to make the most of the Itria Valley, even though we took the train for a day trip to Lecce. 

However make sure you don't get the two different stations Cisternino (on a different train line and a good few kilometres north of the trullo) and Cisternino Cittia (walking distance from the trullo to the station) mixed up like we did! The lines are also run by two different rail companies and the train conductor didn't like us paying the fare to the rival train company instead! The other thing of note should be the Trullo patio is rather popular with the Cisternino cat population; they're of great entertainment but maybe not the best if you have a cat allergy!

The whole trip was wonderful, thanks Luca, Biagio and Mima for a wonderful holiday!!"
943864,2902945,2017-03-24T10:00:08Z,"Clean, comfortable! Perfect for go far from noisy cities!"
943864,13770664,2017-03-19T08:55:18Z,"Trullo traditionnel très bien refait et aménagé avec goût, chauffé très correctement (pour l'hiver...) et bien situé, dans la campagne, à quelques minutes de Cisternino où l'on peut trouver tout ce qu'il faut pour passer de belles vacances.
Et M. et Mme Biagio sont attentifs à ce que tout soit OK.
Pour découvrir la région, l'endroit est parfait, centré et proche de nombreux sites à visiter. Les vieilles villes des environs méritent le coup d'œil ! A 15 km de la mer."

The location was very convenient for our planed trips (visited wonderful places: Matera, Altamura, Lecce, Ostuni, Locorotondo, Cisternino). The kitchen is equipped with all staff you need. Even coffee, olive oil, tee and spices are available."

You do need a car to stay here but well worth the stay. "
943864,67107,2017-01-02T10:27:53Z,"A lovely stay! My mother has been wanting to stay in a trullo for years and Biago's place was perfect and cozy. He was very kind and brought us plenty of pellets for the fire since it was quite cold over New Year's. The best part was the location - not only was it an easy drive to plenty of tourist must-sees, but we had a great view of the fireworks in all the neighboring towns! "
943864,4217247,2016-12-27T10:29:13Z,"We had an unbelievably wonderful stay at the trullo - everything surpassed our expectations. Biagio kept us comfortable and warm with endless supplies of fire pellets and the trullo was fully equipped for us to cook meals. The best thing for us was the location , we rented a car and visited the towns around Puglia, feasting on art, culture and food. This was one of the most staggering and fun holidays I have ever had. Thanks Luca and Biagio - you guys were the best. "

Being near the trulli capital of Alberobello, we were excited to ""live like the locals"" in our very own trullo.  Biaggio has done a nice job making the home up-to-date and modern with a fully equipped kitchen, pellet-stoked fireplace, modern bathroom and shower, and enough room to accommodate five adults.  Although we were not able to meet Biaggio in person, he made sure to have a family friend available to assist us with finding the location and getting us checked in properly.  Thanks for making our visit one to remember!"

The house and overall environment was very friendly, clean, modern and spacious  - we felt like at home, it's been  a superb location (quiet street, a few steps to Morgat center as well as into the unbelievable nature that is all around. On a bike, after  just a few minutes, we reached a beautiful nature areas such as dunes of Dinan, Lostmarch beaches and Cap de la Chevre of course...
We only met Sigrid for a short time when we arrived, she was so nice to wait for us until the late evening, she gave us all the necessary info  - and she was very helpful with an advice where to go eg. for shopping etc., she left us with a smile to use her place, was always on the phone to assist if anything needed.

C'est ici-chez vous que nous l'avons trouvé Sigrid ! De la lumière et même de la transparence -tant d'éléments vitrés nous font un peu vivre dehors-, la douceur permanente générée par le mode de chauffage, la sobriété des lieux et de l'ameublement (une qualité à nos yeux !), le mur-cuisine parfaitement équipé, la cheminée... presque superflue tant il fait bon (nous pensions y avoir recours régulièrement, mais ce fut inutile), aujourd'hui enchantés, nous sommes prêts à réitérer l'expérience... !

We had a good time in Sigrid's house. The house was completely as good as on the pictures, but in reality we were impressed by the fact that it was much bigger than expected. The house was fully equiped and everything was clean. Morgat is a nice town. We liked the Tuesday-evening music festival in the village, which is only during the summer. Highly recommended for a stay in this region."

A casa é exatamente como as fotos, o atendimento é incrível, tudo muito tranquilo. 
O chuveiro é uma delicia e a roupa de cama ótima. 
Recomendamos muito! 
Mas obs: o sinal do Wi-Fi é ruim. "
4789513,90746623,2017-01-23T13:45:25Z,"Experiência inesquecível, realização de um sonho. A casa é aconchegante, nem da vontade de sair pra cidade. A única coisa que poderia melhorar é que como lá é muito bom de ficar na casa, poderia ter a opção de ter o café da manhã na casa da árvore, o café da manhã que tem é muito bom mas é longe da casa, só de ter que levantar da cama e ir pra lá é meio chato. De resto, tudo é perfeito lá! Perfeito MESMO, a questão do cafe é só um detalhe (mas como eu amo café da manhã, senti falta)."
4789513,100175411,2017-01-15T10:58:32Z,"É uma estadia pra ficar na memória. Meu filho amou!
Recomendo para pais que tenham filhos pequenos e que adoram aventuras. Vale muito a pena :)"

Fomos muito bem recepcionados pelo Alon, que ficou sempre de prontidão para qualquer eventualidade. A cidade é pitoresca e com restaurantes maravilhosos, além de tudo as trilhas que existem na cidade são uma ótima opção para quem gosta de estar conectado com a natureza. Além do encanto trazido pela casa na árvore e pela paisagem, há os maravilhosos esquilos, que nos fascinam com suas visitinhas matinais. 
Pretendo retornar em breve!"
4789513,98035886,2016-10-13T14:56:38Z,"This was a great escape from reality! The treehouse is cosy and located in a beautiful peaceful setting. Everything is done to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. We loved our stay!

A casa na árvore foi uma grande fuga da realidade!  É acolhedor e localizado em um belo ambiente tranquilo. Tudo é feito para tornar a sua estadia confortável e agradável. Nós adoramos a nossa visita!"

A casa na árvore condiz bastante com as fotos publicadas no site e no geral é muito aconchegante e charmosa! O Terreno em que a casa está localizada é bastante arborizado e não é difícil avistar aves e esquilos ao redor. Ponto extra pela atenção da Sueli, responsável por nos receber, que tornou nossa estadia ainda mais agradável com sua simpatia e dedicação!      "

Eu e minha namorada fomos super bem tratados pela Sueli (quem nos recepcionou), a cidade é ótima, a cabana é aconchegante na medida certa... Enfim, a vontade é ficar pra lá de uma semana aproveitando tudo o que a cidade e a tranquilidade do local têm a oferecer pra gente."

Super recomendo"
4789513,74995779,2016-07-11T05:45:57Z,Foi realmente incrível a experiência de nos hospedar na casa da arvore.  Alon foi super atencioso desde a reserva e Sueli nos recepcionou muitíssimo bem. A casa era realmente como vimos nas fotos e super aconchegante. Gostamos muitos dos vizinhos esquilos e de toda tranquilidade do lugar. Super indico. Beijos Alon e Sueli.

337642,51420874,2017-05-12T05:46:31Z,"Absolutely perfect! This little cave house is simply magical, and was without doubt the nicest place that we stayed at in Crete! The villa itself is clean and beautifully presented, and the location is tranquil and relaxing. Nantia was a wonderful host, making sure we had all the essentials on arrival and even some delicious little cakes that she had baked. She spent time with us to help us decide where to visit in the area which was so much more than you would ever get if you stayed in a resort hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this beautiful little villa to anyone looking for a romantic and relaxing get away in Crete. "
337642,9784578,2017-05-08T05:23:36Z,"Nantia and Costos are ones of the most hospitable and regardful owners. Very easy to communicate. Check in was easy and very hospitable with tasty local specialties. It took only 15 minutes to talk to Nantia to get full information on all possible activities around the place.
Highly recommend Nantia as an owner to rent with."
337642,107469532,2017-04-16T08:43:43Z,"A lot of thanks to Nantia and her husband. 

We had two very relaxed weeks in this very clean and comfortable cave-appartment. We had immediatly the feeling to bee at home, because we found on the first day typical greet foot /salad and all necessery thing, like salt, bread, oil, vinegar, coffee, tea.. for the first morning on these amazing place.
 
Nantia gave us a lot of helpful suggestion personally - what we can visit, restaurant, about culture and also about the greek foods. We saw a lot of very beatiful places on the westcoste, balos beach, but also Nassos and the maintown. Our favourite place Chania is very near with the care and more worth then one visit.

Birgit & Peter"
337642,67027473,2017-04-02T06:59:19Z,"Had a great stay!
We were greeted with homemade greek salad and cake. The fridge was supplied with water, toast, juice, milk, and beer. We also found a small bottle of wine, olive oil, honey, and some cereal. We were really surprised by the hospitality and generosity!

Everything else is like descripted - we did not miss anything.

The stone house is located in the middle of a small village (that , however, features 3 restaurants), surrounded by pure nature and a lot of sheep ;-) It is a great starting point for hiking and close to the beautiful beaches of Balos and Falassarna."
337642,5130948,2016-10-30T02:49:53Z,"We had a fantastic week at Nantia's stone villa. 

The villa was perfect and absolutely in line with what the pictures suggested. The unusual look with the rock gave it a particular charge. Kaliviani is a nice little village with some great restaurants. Our absolute favorite was Gramvousa - this is a must :) 

We will be happy to come again, next time with some friends and take the larger villa upstairs that also has a pool :). 

Nantia has been an incredible host who has put the service bar at a level unseen before: 1) she was at the villa to welcome us and took some time to sit down and explain what to do in the area (highlights: beaches in Balos, Falasarna, Elafonisi; hiking in Samaria George, strolling around in Chania etc 2) she helped us organize a trip to Samaria George (pickup in Kaliviani, very useful not having to travel to Chania for this), 3) she had prepared salad, cake and some other food for us upon arrival, 4) sheets and towels were exchanged after three days of our stay, 5) she recommended a very nice fine food and gift shop in Kissamos called To Kaniski which is absolutely wonderful, 6) she gave us a good bye present. "
337642,87555415,2016-10-19T06:28:32Z,"Wir hatten einen 8-tägigen Aufenthalt in der ""Luxurious Stone Villa"" und waren sehr zufrieden. Die Gastgeberin ist äußerst zuvorkommend, freundlich und hilfsbereit. Zur Begrüßung gab es selbstgemachten Kuchen, Salat und auch sonst sind im Haushalt alle möglichen ""Basics"" wie Kaffee, Öl, Salz & Pfeffer usw zu finden. Das Ambiente der Wohnung ist entsprechend der Bilder. Interessant und ungewöhnlich mit den Felsen im Innenraum. Insgesamt ist die Wohnung etwas dunkel, was aber nicht wirklich stört, da man tagsüber idR. unterwegs ist. Etwas schade fanden wir die Nordausrichtung des Balkons komplett ohne Sonne, was im Oktober fast schon etwas zu kühl war. Zur Entschädigung hat man allerdings Meerblick ;-) Die kleine Ortschaft Kaliviani ist sehr nett und es gibt 2-3 super Restaurants (unbedingt ins Gramboussa gehen!!) + diverse schöne Strände liegen in erreichbarer Nähe. Insgesamt ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt!"
337642,49366411,2016-09-24T07:30:08Z,"Il nostro soggiorno presso la casa di Nantia è stato fantastico. La casa si trova sulla strada che da Kissamos va alla spiaggia di Balos, in un paesino chiamato Kaliviani. Al nostro arrivo, Nantia ci ha fatto trovare tutto il necessario per un'ottima colazione,bevande fresche nel frigo ed informazioni utili per la nostra vacanza. L'appartamento è magnifico, con le pareti in roccia viva e i dettagli curatissimi. Il letto a baldacchino è la ciliegina sulla torta."
337642,35488518,2016-09-19T02:11:48Z,"Serdecznie dziękujemy za ten wspaniały pobyt i serdeczność jaką okazała nam Nantia. Jej szczera pomoc i opieka sprawiła nam wiele dobrego. Miejsce jest magiczne, zdala od zgiełku turystów. W Kaliviani świetna resrauracja i przemili ludzie. Mogliśmy również skorzystać przez chwilę z basenu. Przyjechaliśmy bardzo późno ale pomimo tego Nantia przyjęła nas swoją gościnnością i pomyślała o wszystkim. Dziękujemy za wszelkie porady, pyszne jedzenie oraz transport z Kissamos do villi Patriko. To była nasza dobra decyzja! Wypoczęci możemy teraz ciepło wspominać Kretę! Pozdrawiamy gorąco"
337642,60749132,2016-09-12T02:38:05Z,"Beautiful and romantic apartment, very quiet and peaceful. The idylic little town is lovely and we had an authentic Greek experience. Nantia welcomed us with warmth, treating us as family during our stay and gave us great advice on the area. We couldn't have asked for anything more."
337642,1013543,2016-09-05T03:25:15Z,"We had a very good experience at the house. The place is located in a charming village. We had everything we needed in the house and the view from the balcony is beautiful. If we come back to crete we will definitely come back.

Mathieu"
337642,58096784,2016-09-03T05:36:52Z,Absolutely wonderful! This was our favorite place during our trip to Crete. 
337642,62050031,2016-09-01T02:27:25Z,"From the beginning to the end our experience was truly AMAZING! The house is located in a very cute village with beaches near by and walking distance to 3 restaurants and a vending place. The house is gorgeous, very clean and super quiet. 
After picking up the rental car and heading towards the house, it was around lunch time. We were starving and for our surprise, there was a Greek Salad in the mini fridge for us! What a nice touch! :) Nantia also left us some cereal, hazelnut spread, tea, honey, coffee, and a super moist and delicious cake. Out of other 2 Airbnb's we used throughout our trip THIS WAS THE BEST!!! Nantia was super helpful from day 1. I highly recommend her place. You will not regret! "
337642,53675907,2016-08-28T02:04:37Z,"Maison de pierre très belle avec une très belle vue sur la mer. Nous y avons séjourné 2 semaines et c'était parfait.
Nantia, la mère de Marietta nous a accueilli avec un plat local préparé par ses soins. Elle nous a expliqué tout ce qu'il fallait savoir pour visiter la région. Nous avons été agréablement surpris pas l'accueil qui nous a été réservé.
Pas loin des belles plages de la côte ouest, la maison est très belle, bien décorée et il fais frais à l'intérieur même en plein mois d'août. 

À notre départ Nantia est venue nous dire au-revoir avec un cadeau en prime.
un hôte que nous n'oublierons pas de si tôt."
337642,49812544,2016-07-13T05:36:19Z,"We have had such a lovely time staying in this anciently picturesque cave house surrounded by peaceful countryside and postcard views. Thank you so much for your generous hospitality and a very warm welcome - that Greek salad you left us was delicious, and the suggestions and recommendations were very helpful - thanks. 

One night here was not enough! We would love to come back next time!

Thank you and we wish you all the best, with warm regards from Olivia and Peter xoxo "
337642,65870179,2016-07-12T10:31:05Z,"Having just returned from the beautiful Cave house in Kalyviani, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to Marietta, Nantia and family for the wonderful welcome and treats we received after our journey from the South of Crete. Villa Patriko is just stunning, beautifully furnished and in a great location between Falasarna and Balos, two of the most stunning areas of Crete. Myself and my daughter travelled to four different places on our trip, this being our last stop and boy did we save the best for last! The cave house is truly magical and we only wished we could have stayed longer. Still now we know you are there, we will be back at our earliest opportunity! This was my first experience of Air B&B and what a difference it made to staying in a hotel! The care and attention we received is real and it really made our trip. Thank you once again for a truly memorable stay! Emma & Imogen."
337642,15780193,2016-06-25T03:18:09Z,"Marietta and Nantia made us feeling as we were at home. Studio Katoi is as shown in the pictures and the description is fully correct. Being in a natural cave, the temperature is lower than outside which make it a good choice in summer.
When we arrive, we were welcomed with delicious food and products from Crete and Nantia had even prepared a cake for our 1 year daughter birthday! She gave us very useful touristic information and hints to make our experience better. She also provided us a baby chair and a cot.
Good base point to discover the west of Crete. 
Highly recommended"
337642,26056884,2016-06-15T05:28:32Z,"Of the Airbnbs I've stayed in, this one is my favorite! Marietta and her mother were very good at keeping in touch with me and checking in to make sure everything was okay. They left lovely food welcoming gifts for us, which we really appreciated! As for the place itself, it is beautiful, clean, and unique. The location of it is in a cute little village but it is perfect for getting to all the main beaches around that area. The only thing I'd advise is to rent a small car, as the roads are really a tight squeeze. Overall, Marietta and her mother were gracious and thoughtful hosts. I'd definitely recommend!"
337642,14197626,2016-05-28T05:13:56Z,"Firstly we would like to say that this was the most welcome we have ever been made feel on any holiday. We were met by Marietta's mother, who made us feel so comfortable, providing us with advice of where to eat and visit, wine and snacks, plus gifts and cake because it was my birthday! The villa is a wonderful place to stay, it is beautiful, very clean and decorated wonderfully. The stunning views from the balcony are more beautiful than the pictures, a lovely place to have breakfast. It is very easy to find, it is on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps, and is in a lovely quiet village with a shop and a very nice restaurant overlooking the sea. It is very easy to get to Falasarna beach, and is easy by car to drive to Balos and Elafonisi, which we recommend. Both drives are up cliff/mountain roads, but they are very beautiful and worth it. The town of Kissamos is a short drive away if you need more shops or restaurants. The people are so friendly in Crete, you will have a wonderful time. This apartment is beautiful. Thank you for being such great hosts, we will be back! "
337642,4933926,2016-05-22T06:50:07Z,"The apartment/grotto is unique and comfortable. The view on the mountain and on the bay is magnifique and the neighbours very friendly. Also, the restaurant Gamboussa close to the place is the best we have been to in Crete (and the service also is very good and the view worth the detour). We foundly recommand this place.
Lyne and Alan, Montréal (QC) Canada"
337642,66402361,2016-05-19T02:45:51Z,"The listing perfectly described the villa, it was better than expected. We were greeted by Marietta's mother at first,she was the (URL HIDDEN) happy and welcoming followed by her father who was great as well. They were just putting the finishing touches on the place when we arrived. We went to get a drink at one of the 2 great restaurants within a 2 minute walk while they got it ready. Marietta called us and asked if we would join them for dinner, where we got to meet the entire family, 3 generations and everyone was beyond welcoming and wonderful. They showed us their favorites on the menu and we had a great meal that was on of the best on our travels through Greece. I would recommend their place and more. There was a bottle of good rose' waiting for us after dinner in the room too. Don't even hesitate to come here, Elafonisi beach was only an hour a way, and Balos beach park was 5 minutes away and one of the most beautiful beaches i've ever seen. (and i'm from Hawaii). Great Experience, wonderful people and and amazing house."
5704246,9788979,2017-05-11T15:30:32Z,"Everything about this place is beautiful! The staff were extremely helpful, and they spoke amazing English. We loved the delicious breakfast and cocktails by the pool. It's just as beautiful as the pictures suggest. You're a little out of the way from the main part of Havana, but the lovely staff called cabs for us whenever we wanted. Can't wait to come back! "
5704246,78090268,2017-05-04T18:51:19Z,"La Rosa de Ortega is an a exceptional casa, as well concerning the magnificent house as towards the staff and their attitude towards guests. We spent our last day of the holiday in this casa and it was a perfect ending. "
5704246,22405608,2017-05-03T18:07:16Z,Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit bei Julia und Silvio. Alles ist sehr liebevoll und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Frühstück und Mittagessen waren üppig und lecker. Alle Angestellten waren sehr freundlich und professionell. Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder!
5704246,32888874,2017-05-01T15:23:28Z,Beautiful house and property! Most luxurious place we stayed in Cuba. 
5704246,75191237,2017-04-25T12:14:00Z,"My wife and I had an absolute splendid time at La Rosa de Ortega! Julia and her entire staff were incredibly warm and helpful. The home is a complete gem, incredibly unique rooms (compared to what you might find here in Minnesota!), great food available throughout the day.

We chose here for the last leg of our trip in Cuba, having already stayed in Centro Havana. It was a great relaxing ending to the vacation. (Do know that it's about a $15 taxi ride to get to the Centro/Vieja area of Havana.)

We've already sent some friends here that traveled to Cuba after us and we ourselves can't wait to go again!"
5704246,61439903,2017-04-19T13:52:21Z,"We spent two nights at Julia and Silvio's place and in hindsight we wish we spent our entire trip here. The rooms were beautiful, the breakfast was lovely and Javier and the team were so welcoming and helpful. We were recommended good local restaurants, the team arranged taxis for us and helped us arrange transport to Vinales. 

We stayed in two other places in Havana and Julia and Silvio's place easily took first place.

5704246,99405111,2017-04-17T14:19:13Z,"Excelente estadía. La casa y habitación es exactamente como se muestra en las fotos. Julia, Javier y todo el personal nos trataron de maravillas. Sin duda lo recomendamos 100%. "
5704246,41710073,2017-04-13T15:20:16Z,Really friendly hosts and a great massage!
5704246,4820538,2017-04-07T14:16:47Z,"Nos encantó la casa de Julia y Silvio, preciosa mansion renovada con unas vistas impresionantes de la ciudad, piscina y muchos otros servicios. La gente que trabajan en la casa muy amables y dispuestos a ayudarnos todo el tiempo. Estuvimos en 2 habitaciones diferentes y son todas muy grandes, limpias y renovadas. La comida también buenísima. Posibilidad de ir al centro en transporte público  (unos 30 minutos) o con los taxis propuestos en la casa. Recomiendo 100% para conocer un lado desconocido de la Habana."
5704246,22938996,2017-04-06T13:19:18Z,"We enjoyed our last night in Havana here, it was a welcome change from the awful B&B we experienced earlier on in our trip. We had a great time lounging by the pool, and they offer snacks and drinks at the bar by the pool. The bartender was very friendly and prepared the most amazing salad for me on request. Their home is absolutely stunning, and close to exceptional restaurants which they recommend. The only downside is that it is quite far from the centre of Havana, for us it was good as we had spend most of our stay in Havana more central, but if you are looking to be more central then this is a little further out. Overall a great stay! "
5704246,76620192,2017-04-05T13:21:27Z,"A gorgeous house in a stunning setting. Julio and Silvia are so friendly and all the staff, particularly Mercedes, made us feel very welcome. There was a gorgeous pool and breakfast area on the patio and breakfast was fantastic. We had a lovely room with a juliet balcony and poster bed and it was a relaxing and authentic place to stay."
5704246,12982902,2017-04-03T14:17:43Z,"What else can we say about this place except for amazing, we wished we were here for more than 1 one night. We came to La Rosa de Ortega after 2 nights in Old Havana, wanting a quiet and peaceful evening and to relax by the pool. We got that and more. We had a warm welcome with juice accommodating straight through until we left with big hugs. The house is beautiful in an unsuspecting neighborhood and the rooms were perfect. It was the best quiet retreat- we will be back very soon!!"
5704246,13828580,2017-03-27T13:31:39Z,"Beautiful house and grounds (but a lot of stairs).
Breakfast and lunch very good and worth the extra cost.
Overall we had a relaxing 2 days chilling at the pool."
5704246,88365924,2017-03-26T06:27:01Z,Absolutely beautiful and quiet location outside of the bustle of Havana. The room was exactly as the pictures and the hosts and their staff were lovely and helpful. Great breakfast and some nice restaurants near by! Great way to end our Cuba trip thank you again!!! 
5704246,105052932,2017-03-19T12:39:46Z,"Hermoso lugar muy recomendable, las personas muy atentas y amables, todo muy agradable.
La habitación realmente es tal cual a las fotos, muy hermosa y cómoda.
Como única contra la ubicación, no es lejos pero las calles por ahí están muy golpeadas y los taxista o no te quieren llevar o te cobran muy caro, pero siempre podes regatear!.
Quedamos muy contentos con nuestra estadía allí, la recomendamos :) 

Saludos Franco y Julieta

5704246,172871,2017-02-28T15:04:45Z,"La rosa de Ortega is incredibly beautiful and was a great respite from the bustle of Havana during the middle of our trip. 

The whole house is decorated incredibly well and our room was really lovely. Breakfast by the pool followed by a quick dip was the perfect way to start a long day of walking the streets of Havana. 

The staff was very helpful setting up taxis to the city center and a day trip to Vinales for really reasonable prices. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone staying in Havana, especially if you are staying more than a few days and think you'll need a place to relax and recharge. "
5704246,5895565,2017-02-24T15:47:03Z,"We loved it here. We stayed a week and could have stayed even longer. The breakfasts are out of this world. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Lots of singing birds, a sleepy German shepherd, and really pretty sunsets outside our windows. Drivers have a tough time finding it sometimes on the way back home, but I printed a map of it before I left that I kept with me. That was helpful. The bnb was booked for our friends traveling with us, but they were able to book at a hotel across the street, which worked out for everyone. Completely recommend this place. It's really nice to be able to leave the noise of the city at night to come up to your peaceful retreat. Thanks for all your hospitality! We plan on returning! "
5704246,32102704,2017-02-19T14:18:26Z,Beautiful property with a pool! Ideal for more quiet nights when in cuba.

833602,61149852,2017-05-10T10:22:07Z,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Milano I would with out a doubt stay at Nir's apartment. It is close to the train station so you can just walk over. The apartment is so cute and clean. This was our 9th Airbnb and it was perfect for a city visit. Nir is super nice, speaks 3 languages and is so helpful. He let us check out a little later with no charge. He gave us great advice and showed us where we could walk to for a simple yummy dinner.  We walked to the Duomo the next morning. He is great to communicate with before and during your stay. "
833602,63533865,2017-05-08T09:07:23Z,Nir is a super host! He is super friendly and took the time to recommend us things to do during our short stay. The apartment is in a great central location. I would say it's the half way point between the train station and all the shops. Super easy to walk! Thank you for your hospitality Nir; hope to be back soon!
833602,43138494,2017-05-08T04:22:54Z,If Nir's place is available you are very lucky and book it immediately! Right in the centre of Milan it's close to shops/sights and restaurants. Nir was the perfect host and nothing was too much trouble! There's a reason why Nir is a super host! Belinda 
833602,99644493,2017-05-06T07:27:09Z,"If you are planning a trip to Milan, a visit to Nir's apartment is a must. It is very close to centrale train station and only a short walk the metro. The location is excellent with many bars and restaurants close by.

Nir is a fantastic host, he gave us the directions from centrale station which made life much easier and once checked in he took the time to recommend places to go!

The apartment is homely and very clean and is ideal for a short break.. we will return!"
833602,14104130,2017-05-04T07:16:18Z,"Nir's apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood while a short distance away from the main road. The apartment is sufficiently equipped and fully functional, allowing you to have a good bath and a night of sweet sleep. Last but not least, we can keep in touch with the host at any time of the day prior to and during our stay. "
833602,22764298,2017-05-02T09:28:17Z,"Tuvimos una gran experiencia con Nir. Todo lo que necesitamos, lo teniamos a nuestro alcance. Super completo el departamento y exacto a las fotos. Muy cómodo. Muy limpio. Sin dudas es un gran anfitrión. Recomendado 100%

833602,8839616,2017-04-22T14:59:15Z,"La casina di Nir è deliziosa, curata, silenziosa, accogliente, perfettamente attrezzata. A due passi a piedi dalla stazione centrale e in un quartiere molto carino, con un sacco di locali. Nir poi è un vero host: amichevole, comunicativo, preciso. Un'esperienza deliziosa"
833602,63176649,2017-04-21T07:44:58Z,"Nir was the absolute perfect host! Not only that, but his flat is lovely and had everything we needed. Food, sights and the train station are all within walking distance. And Nir was nice enough to not only suggest where to go, but also map things out for us! (Best Airbnb host I've had!) We wished we could have stayed longer and are already planning to stay in Milan the next time were in Italy. Thanks Nir! :)"
833602,96852157,2017-04-20T06:29:03Z,Nir was a great host and the apartment was as advertised.  The Lima station (red line) was very close and it was easy to navigate to the Duomo and other great spots in Milan.  Nir provided helpful tips and walked us through the map.  Don't hesitate.  This is a great place to stay.
833602,3936601,2017-04-17T08:30:37Z,Best experience staying at airbnb ever! Nir is such a kind host and I couldn't ask for more than his place has to offer. Room is very nice and cozy. Great communication from the beginning till checking out. He deserves to be Super host!
833602,68771491,2017-04-16T08:59:00Z,Nir's apartment is very close to the heart of Milan.  The apartment was very clean and every amenity was complete.  What was so impressive was Nir was so helpful in every way and spent a great deal of his time to ensure our stay was pleasant.  The Sicilian restaurant he recommended was exceptional.  We wanted to thank Nir was his hospitality and generosity.  It made our stay truly special.  
833602,100816923,2017-04-15T06:24:07Z,"Nir was a very good host. He was kind and communication was very easy. Very fast replies. When we arrived, he was very nice, he showed us all the apartment facilities and gave us some tips about the best points in the city.
The apartment is cozy and very well decorated and the location is very good, near to some good restaurants and not far at all from the heart of Milan. Nir also left the apartment fully equipped for us, with clean towels, some shower stuff and coffee.  
If going back to Milan, I will definitly stay there again!"
833602,8732854,2017-04-14T14:39:19Z,"It was a perfect flat! Nir is a very friendly host! We enjoyed our stay in Milan a lot. We got a lot of advices from Nir where to go for shopping, sightseeing and eating. We can recommend to stay at Nir's place and will definitely come back."
833602,43976049,2017-04-12T09:10:43Z,"公寓很干净,设备齐全,位置很好,离中心火车站不到十分钟路程,公寓拐角处有家鱼店,海鲜很新鲜,价格合理,我推荐大家入住。the apartment is very clean with all facilities you need. It only takes ten minutes to the central station. There is a seafood store around the corner. That is a plus. The host is very nice and friendly. I recommend it to all."
833602,104965055,2017-04-11T08:21:12Z,"The apartment was clean and very quiet,great location, easy walk from train station and close to metro stop. Tks Nir and Tom!"
833602,100836540,2017-04-08T07:16:27Z,"Nirs apartment is great.  Everything you could need which was perfect for a very busy week.  
An easy walk from Central Station and within 3-5 minutes walk of at least 3 Metro stops. 

All the stores you could want or need are within a couple of minutes walk too.  Cafes, bakeries, restaurants in the same street however the street is nice and quiet. 

Scenic walk into Duomo takes about 20 mins so a great spot to stay for a tourist or business visitor. 
Nir left milk, juice, snacks etc. such a nice guy! 

Definitely strongly recommend.  "
833602,6180883,2017-04-05T08:27:12Z,"Second time at Nir's apartment. Great location, easy walk from train station and close to metro stop.

This bnb is up 4 flights of stairs and built in 1677 but it's clean and modern inside! Completely blew us away - with fully equipped and stocked kitchen with supplies for 3 days brekkies, plus a washing machine and strong internet connection (rare in Italy it seems). We felt so spoiled. The studio apartment is light filled and so comfy and charming we just wanted to stay in it but of course we went sightseeing. The bridge to Trastevere is 50m away and it's only a 20 min walk to Vatican City. Location can't be beat! Great suggestions of restaurants from lovely hosts. Everything has been thought of. Also, I loved the leftover travel items from other guests, felt like a treasure trove of travel wealth! "
747656,109043439,2017-05-09T08:52:08Z,Super close to all the main attractions yet secluded enough to be away from the noise. Bed was super comfortable. Overall I was very satisfied with my stay!
747656,9332158,2017-05-05T06:17:02Z,"Amazing place! Totally worth the stay, right in the centre of Rome. We took advantage of the transfer from the Airport. Despite very long lines at the passport control they were waiting for us. Rita went above and beyond with prosecco and rose petals for our honeymoon. The apartment is small but has everything, great location. Recommended!"
747656,6910796,2017-05-02T08:21:07Z,"Rita's place is perfect for anyone who hasn't been to Rome before, the location is brilliant - literally 20 mins to walk to all the attractions. There's a square round the corner with fantastic restaurants and bars and we couldn't recommend highly enough. We used her services for a lift back and forth from the airport and it was easy as anything. Would stay again definitely! Thanks Rita and Fabio! "
747656,93464464,2017-04-24T07:11:19Z,The small but cozy apartment ist perfectly located to walk to all of the sights in Rome. Rita picked us up at the airport which was perfect and she made us so welcome in her place! She also went the extra mile and provided us with a bottle of sparkling wine and some rosebuds for our honeymoon. 
747656,15327666,2017-04-21T07:55:47Z,"Eine sehr schöne Wohnung in einer wunderschönen Lageund eine sehr zuvorkommende, herzliche Gastgeberin! Wunderbar!"
747656,92387209,2017-04-14T07:35:03Z,"The apartment is very well situated in old Rome, with so many wonderful restaurants and wine bars to explore, and only a short walk to all of Romes amazing things to see."
747656,69051822,2017-04-12T07:39:47Z,Superbe séjour à Rome. Le logement de Rita est parfait pour un couple. Idéalement situé vous pouvez aller à pied pour visiter les monuments ( 30mn environ). Nous avons aussi apprécié le transfert proposé aeroport/ logement. 
747656,63379365,2017-04-10T08:55:09Z,"This was my first experience with air bnb and it topped all my expectations.  It's a small but very cozy apartment that was perfect for myself and my teenage daughter.  Rita had the apartment stocked with everything we could imagine.  The location of the apartment was ideal.  We walked everywhere and at night had tons of restaurant options within a few blocks.  You do have to walk up a few flights, it didn't bother us we felt like it added to the charm of the apartment but if stairs are difficult for you this may be a problem.  "
747656,3991362,2017-04-08T09:48:11Z,"I loved Rita's place! I was only in Rome one night but I immediately felt at home. Check in was easy and the flat was charming, clean, and had everything I needed."
747656,41738679,2017-04-08T03:33:08Z,"Rita & Fabio’s place was perfect for us. If you don’t mind a walk up the 4 story staircase, you will not find a better location. The apartment itself is small, cozy, quiet and very well equipped with a very comfortable bed and window shutters that will let you completely block out sun light if so desired. The extra touches - like picking us up from the airport and a full refrigerator, wine upon arrival - made it a really great experience. Rita was always prompt in answering any questions. I would book it again without hesitation. 

The location itself is within a couple of hundred feet of a small but useful grocery store, a very good coffee bar and a gelateria. The street it is on has  a fair amount of foot traffic since it is right at Ponte Sisto which many Romans use to get to Trastevere. The Regola area has become my favorite area to stay with plenty for anyone to do, no matter what your interests - we spent a couple of days just exploring this area. It really is a quite pleasant neighborhood. There are many restaurants, bars, bakeries, shopping areas and places of historical, architectural and artistic interest nearby (the rear of Palazzo Spada can be seen from the window). Many of the popular tourist attractions are within walking distance. If you want a more “authentic” Rome experience without giving up easy access to popular attractions, book this place.

Thank you Rita & Fabio!"
747656,102890127,2017-03-27T07:51:38Z,"Great apartment, centrally located near all the tourist attractions.  Rita provided so many complimentary items; coffee, juice and yogurt.  What a great host!"
747656,14996453,2017-03-26T07:11:53Z,Sehr klein aber sehr zentral und sauber
747656,32617355,2017-03-24T08:59:36Z," This place is perfect if you want to have a comfortable little home to stay in while visiting Rome. We were able to walk to all the main attractions in the city, which was perfect. It is not super big but it is very clean and comfortable and has everything you need. It really felt like home! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to all of my friends. "
747656,67500664,2017-03-22T08:03:12Z,"Rita's suite is a jewel in the heart of Rome, ideal for a romantic getaway or just if you wanna have a special place to estabilish a deep contact with Rome.
In a 17th Century building, a narrow stair will lead you to a little nest, so comfortable, where you'll find everything you need, included a rich breakfast.
The shower and the bed are OK, no rumors at all.
"
747656,28236139,2017-03-20T07:25:56Z,The apartment was very cute and had everything we needed. The location is perfect and we were able to walk everywhere. Rita was very helpful with us. Highly recommended!!
747656,63010602,2017-03-17T07:33:40Z,Rita and her husband were wonderful hosts! They were very kind from the very beginning. The apartment was in a great location for us and worked out for a place to rest our head at night. It was rather small for my husband and I and our luggage and the water pressure was pretty low. But other than that no complaints! She even provides you with yogurts and snacks for breakfast. So considerate! 
747656,86917452,2017-03-12T08:45:37Z,Small but great!
747656,90039764,2017-03-11T10:56:55Z,"Location location location! Apart from being adorable, the apartment was within reasonable walking distance from all the great sights (coliseum, Vatican, trevi fountain, etc!) but you are also far enough out of tourist-town to really enjoy the authentic culture! "
747656,56082682,2017-03-05T09:15:56Z,Rita is great. Her home is in the centre of the city; everything walking distance. Just great! 
1233784,13303482,2017-05-05T07:12:10Z,"It is with regret we depart Mariana's lovely flat.  It was ideal for our stay in Porto...perfectly located, clean, comfortable and well equipped down to Mariana's comprehensive list of sights to see, restaurants, bars, etc to visit.  Should I ever be fortunate enough to again visit Porto....Mariana's is where I'll head!"
1233784,37572119,2017-05-02T11:27:45Z,"Mariana is a friendly host, can answer questions. Apartment is very neat and clean, the location is the center point, convenient transportation, introduced to the next guest."
1233784,14013760,2017-04-28T07:07:29Z,"What a gem! The apartment was clean, beautiful, and made us feel like it were our own home. The location is incredibly convenient—probably a 3 minute walk from São Bento station! Would definitely return as we loved the city as much as we loved staying here."
1233784,38853319,2017-04-26T08:37:37Z,Fantastic location and apartment! The terrasa was spectacular. I don't recommend driving in during rush hour - it was very hectic. Parking garage nearby was very reasonable if you pay up front. Thanks for being a great host in a spectacular city!
1233784,51308045,2017-04-25T10:41:24Z,"Outstanding apartment. Great value for money, amazing views and perfect location."
1233784,106267328,2017-04-21T08:23:35Z,Perfeita acomodação na melhor localização do Porto. Levamos nosso filho de 6 meses e ainda foi possível ter um berço no quarto. Fantástico. 
1233784,47063923,2017-04-11T10:42:55Z,Thank you so much for letting us stay in your lovely apartment. We had the best time and even got to enjoy a glass of wine at the terrace with the most amazing view. Recommended!

1233784,5102956,2017-04-06T07:15:20Z,Stunning apartment right in the middle of town. We loved staying at the top of Rua da Flores and it was a perfect location for exploring Porto. The penthouse apartment has great views and is very well set-up.
1233784,14412496,2017-03-27T07:40:00Z,"The place was very beautiful and well situated. The ad does say 2 beds but you are apparently expected to tell the host that you don't want to share one bed, otherwise only one bed is prepared. Host did send someone back right away when we asked for bedding for the bed that pulls out under the one bed. overall beautiful place. "
1233784,108886585,2017-03-26T10:39:52Z,"Super schöne und sehr zentral gelegene Wohnung in mitten von Porto. Einfache Buchung, super Kommunikation mit Mariana.

1233784,20950940,2017-03-18T11:42:22Z,Mariana's place is a gem right in central Porto. Perfect location for going back and forth across the bridge to different wineries and restaurants. The private deck was our favorite part- we had wine and cheese on the deck and it was perfect! 
1233784,19303125,2017-03-01T10:17:03Z,Perfect modern apartment in a great central location. Could not ask for more
1233784,27995757,2017-02-27T08:15:08Z,This place is awesome. I was only in Porto one day but the apartment is centrally located that everything was very close by. The view from the top is like no other. It's in the heart of where you need to be if you want to get to all the major attractions in Porto. I walked everywhere. Mariana was also very accommodating by letting me drop off my stuff before the check-in time. Would defiantly recommend staying here. 
1233784,114009363,2017-02-24T09:07:01Z,We had a great time in Porto. The location of the Penthouse is just perfect!

The views are amazing and it is 5-10 minutes walking to all the sites and the river. I don't think you could find a better place to stay in Porto, I would highly recommend renting her place! "
1233784,18873791,2017-02-12T10:56:21Z,"We had an amazing weekend. The house is very central and you have several great restaurants, bars and caffees nearby and you can walk prettu much anywhere. The metro is just accross the road.

If we come back to Porto we will definitely try to stay here again!"
270050,20851862,2017-04-29T08:47:47Z,Xaviers house is a really nice stay to escape from busy Barcelona. The location couldn't be better and the room was beautiful. Too bad the weather was bad so we couldn't use the rooftop! The house is clean and Xavier was helpful. Gracias Xavier for the nice stay! 
270050,73625520,2017-04-19T06:11:15Z,"Xavier is a great host, easy to reach and V good English. The place is next doors to Picasso Museum in a strict centre location but less noisy than the rest of it. Bedroom and toilet were in good condition, roof top terrace has a great view on Santa Maria del Mar church. Would highly recommend this place.
Thanks Xavier!"
270050,38377547,2017-04-14T08:41:23Z,"Wir hatten einen wunderbaren Aufenthalt bei Xavier, der uns sehr nett empfangen hat. Die Lage der Wohnung könnte nicht besser sein. Die Wohnung ist so wie auf den Fotos dargestellt. "
270050,2914588,2017-04-09T09:46:04Z,"Practically attached to Picasso Museum, Xavier's home is central to some of the oldest spots in town, trendy shops and hidden bodegas. Easy communication made it a breeze to check in and out. "
270050,45737959,2017-04-08T09:12:45Z,Very nice place in the centre of Barcelona. I highly recommend this place for a nice stay in Barcelona.
270050,25306014,2017-03-25T10:19:59Z,"Xavier's place is at the perfect location. His place is almost 400 years old and well designed. We couldn't stay a lot at the house because of our short holiday but we wish we could've spent more time in the house. 

As for xavier, we couldn't see him during our stay since he had to work. But he and his firend helped us alot when we need them.

If we go back to Barcelona again, we will definitely stay at his house!"
270050,29720423,2017-03-17T09:56:24Z,Everything is good especially the location.

270050,98724548,2017-03-12T10:04:56Z,"Right in the middle of the gothic quarter, Xavi's place has the charm of history on the outside with a very modern, comfortable interior. Not too far from the nightlife of the ""new"" Barcelona, Xavi's place allows any visitor to experience the new and old world seamlessly. Xavi is a gracious and warm host. Also, croissants and muffins every morning!"
270050,91127501,2017-03-02T08:51:30Z,Wunderbare Wohnung (mit Dachterrasse) mit sehr freundlichem Gastgeber in perfekter Lage. 
270050,6931946,2017-02-24T09:07:34Z,"We loved our 5 day stay at Xavier's. The location is unbeatable especially for people who prefer walking around to explore the alley. It is 10minute walk to the Ramblas and Mercet de Boqueria, 10-15 min to Barcelonata Beach and only 20minute to Casa Batllo. It is located right next to Picasso Museum and El Born with lots of hip tapa places and bars that open till late.

Xavier was friendly, flexible with check in times and keeping our luggage until departure time. The house was charming and our room was clean. 

We had the most amazing stay the first three days, especially without any other guests in the other bedroom. We had to work around each other's shower time on the last two days (it was actually quite funny to hear everyone's alarm go off at the same time ! ) but nothing unmanageable. 

Overall, highly recommnd Xavier's place ! "
270050,13563265,2017-02-19T10:09:25Z,"Xavier est un hôte aimable et discret mais disponible. Il connait très bien sa ville et saura à votre demande vous donner de bons conseils. Il vous donne l'accès à sa cuisine pour préparer votre petit déjeuner.  Vous aurez de la même manière accès à son salon séjour, un lieu très spacieux et de caractère  pour y déguster l'incontournable jambon ibérique et le vin que vous vous serez procurés pour votre repas du soir.
Nous en garderons un très bon souvenir. "
270050,13371928,2017-02-13T09:18:29Z,"This is a fantastic place to stay in Barcelona, seconds from the Picasso museum. The host was very gracious upon arrival and had everything you might need for a wonderful stay (including free snacks and wifi). The room was clean and very comfortable. 

The only other things to note are that it shares a bathroom with other guests and the airbnb is up many flights of steps! "
270050,53186013,2017-02-05T10:55:32Z,Xavier is very comfortable and easy going and the living room is a beautiful as in the pictures!
270050,11470551,2017-01-29T10:30:01Z,"Nice big room, awesome part of town. Clean place and Xavier was easy to communicate with. If you're a light sleeper or sensitive to noise, maybe just pack some ear plugs - if the room adjacent is filled some sound carries. But that's all really - lovely home."
270050,109121100,2017-01-23T07:43:35Z,"房子特别美,房间很舒服,宽敞干净,床很大很软。客厅很有品味,提供的早餐也很美味。关键是地理位置实在太好了,楼下很多很多小店,到的第一晚就在楼下吃了海鲜饭和各种小吃,很便宜。周围各种景点十分钟就走到了,实在是太棒了!如果非要说缺点的话,房间里没有纸巾和垃圾桶有点不方便,房门也没有锁。不过总体来的很棒很棒。"
270050,59282047,2017-01-11T09:29:49Z,"We found Xavier's place really nice, great location and nice to come back to after a day of exploring. Xavier was a great host, he was very helpful but also kept to himself and gave us our privacy. "
270050,22924645,2016-12-18T08:59:26Z,"Situation idéale car tout à fait centrale dans la vieille ville de Barcelone.
Xavier est un hôte charmant, à l'écoute et très serviable.
"
270050,56095622,2016-11-30T07:04:59Z,"El Born is a mixture of all the best and worse in the city. A litle dark, dirty, caotic...but is a beatifull place to stay in Barcelona. A vast option of original places to eat and drink and all the city cultural explosion. Our stay  was nice, very good sleeping time, a clean place, everything you need and a very atencious host. But only one complain: need keys in the rooms doors."
270050,83787365,2016-11-25T08:06:55Z,"The place is very recommend! Picasso museum is just steps away, the apartment is tasteful and artistic. The host is nice and polite. "
6333040,92438690,2017-05-13T14:41:59Z,"This is a true gem of a place! The house itself has a very cool vibe, is impeccably maintained and anything you could possibly need was there. The location was perfect as it was less than a block from the train and within a walk of so many restaurants, bars and attractions like Coors Field, Union Station, etc. While it's centrally located, it also felt private and wasn't noisy at all. Mick and Patrick were great hosts, there when you need them but left you to do your thing. Do yourself a favor and book this place!"
6333040,65592201,2017-05-08T20:18:07Z,What a beautiful house! The decorations are amazing and the entire carriage house is so relaxing. Everything was so easy and Mick provided wonderful accommodations and snacks. Simply wonderful!
6333040,92061941,2017-05-07T17:28:04Z,A cool spot!
6333040,98975986,2017-04-30T17:07:14Z,Mick's place was fantastic! Very nicely decorated and he answered all of our questions thoroughly and quickly. He gives great advice and was all around the best host we could have had. Definitely 5 star!!! Loved all of it! 
6333040,6960459,2017-04-27T15:22:15Z,"I highly recommend Mick's place. It was a really beautiful and comfortable space. The location is wonderful--close to great breweries, restaurants and bars.  Mick was really easy to work with. If I ever come to Denver again, I know where to stay!"
6333040,113048706,2017-04-24T16:46:35Z,Such a charming little getaway in the perfect place! Very clean and cozy. Close to everything fun! I had a short enjoyable stay and plan to definitely book here again for my future stays. 
6333040,20847177,2017-04-23T14:26:25Z,"Mick was a gracious and responsive host. His little carriage house in the RINO district of Denver is the perfect place! Everything that we could ever ask for was within walking distance. Parking was a non-issue. And we had no problem with the fact that it was a rainy weekend during our stay–the home in itself was reason enough to visit. Not to mention Mick coached a fun and challenging crossfit class! Glad to know I could work off all of the amazing food we ate from around the neighborhood. When in Denver, we'll definitely be back!"
6333040,66717005,2017-04-20T14:48:29Z,"We only met Mick briefly, but he was a very kind host ! The home was both beautiful and very clean upon our arrival. Mick provided us with some snacks and a little prosecco :) We definitely enjoyed the space - it was walking distance from the areas we wanted to check out. We also enjoyed the jacuzzi ! Would definitely stay with Mick and Patrick again ! "
6333040,23463419,2017-04-19T15:04:44Z,I would highly recommend a stay at this beautiful place! Mick was very friendly and helpful and the location was great. Lots of nice restaurants and bars nearby but the neighbourhood itself was very peaceful. If we're in Denver again I would definitely return!
6333040,44528168,2017-04-18T17:23:53Z,"The carriage house was absolutely beautiful - just like in the photos! Mick was a very kind host. I wish we would have had more time to chat. 
We were able to walk everywhere from the house. Many restaurants were close by (easily within .25-1 mile). We even walked downtown to visit the US Mint (~2 miles). Lots of the restaurants and bars allow dogs on their patio, but sometimes only on the other side of the metal rail. 
I can't recommend the carriage house enough. It is so beautiful! It is tucked back behind Mick's main home with a beautiful garden surrounding it. Very peaceful and feels secluded!"
6333040,109094780,2017-04-16T16:32:10Z,Wonderful place. The pictures are accurate. Great hosts and very relaxing. The perfect place. Would stay again.
6333040,61012126,2017-04-14T21:11:13Z,A very nice place with updated features and a great interior design!
6333040,71383546,2017-04-13T17:52:37Z,"Perfect for a relaxing, private space near downtown and Curtis Park. Make sure to check in before shopping.  The Carriage House has ample amenities!"
6333040,66386036,2017-04-02T15:57:03Z,"We had a wonderful stay at the carriage house! The decor is amazing and the space was perfect for us. Our hosts were so gracious leaving us lots of snacks and beverages, and house instructions were very clear. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here and hope to be back myself again soon. "
6333040,4516857,2017-04-01T16:52:54Z,"Mick's place is just as dreamy as the photos depict! Off street parking was easy to find and the place was very clean, cozy, and inviting. The extra towels, keyless entry, stocked fridge, and house manual made our trip enjoyable! We only wish we could have extended our stay : )"
6333040,58393018,2017-03-31T17:15:55Z,Mick was such a great host! He had a whole booklet with wonderful suggestions! The carriage house was beautiful! I would definitely stay again of I were back in Denver!
6333040,91687502,2017-03-29T15:22:30Z,"This is a must stay! It was relaxing, beautiful and everything needed for a long drive. Thanks Mick for a great experience even for so short. Highly recommended "
6333040,37672130,2017-03-27T16:53:03Z,We had a great stay in Mick's place! Could easily walk to breweries and shops in the area. The place was clean and had everything we could have needed. Would definitely recommend staying here while in Denver!
6333040,94558011,2017-03-24T16:55:37Z,"So quiet and yet close to downtown, restaurants, breweries, and all kinds of fun things!  The room was very clean and the decor was so cool!  Highly recommended!"
6333040,110885621,2017-03-17T15:10:55Z,Mick and his carriage house are awesome! Highly recommended! 
342074,118776399,2017-04-22T09:21:48Z,"The apartment was beautiful and comfortable and Gianluca was extremely helpful, meeting us and showing us where to park and giving us some tips of where to eat etc. We had a lovely time despite the unusual cold snap during our visit. Highly recommend!!!! "
342074,41850090,2017-04-15T06:41:09Z,"Elegant and convenient apartment just a few minutes' walk from the centre of the old town. If you want to explore Lecce, and the region, this makes an excellent base for your trip. Very helpful and welcoming host. Would thoroughly recommend staying here. "
342074,111803137,2017-04-06T09:41:09Z,"Not much to look at from the outside, but lovely inside, and in a superb location for getting into Lecce centre. The accommodation was impeccably clean, with great facilities (coffee maker, milk frother, bottle opener....all the essentials!). Gianluca gave us a brief introductory tour of our location, so we could get our bearings, and some great advice on where to eat and shop. We would definitely go back again."
342074,26008856,2017-03-31T07:08:38Z,"We had a lovely stay in Lecce at Gianluca's place. The apartment was in great proximity to the centre of Lecce and all the baroque history we were there to see, only 5 minutes walk. 
When we arrived Gianluca was on hand to guide us to the apartment and help us find suitable parking. He gave us a warm welcome and advised us on good local restaurants - two of which we took his advice on, and they were both lovely. 
The apartment itself was spacious, clean and with great facilities. The only downside was it was a little cold, but that's our fault for booking in the off season! 
I'd fully recommend visiting Lecce, it's a wonderful city and we'll definitely return and hopefully stay with Gianluca again at his great apartment."
342074,1536320,2017-03-26T08:54:27Z,"Lovely antique apartment very close to the centre of Lecce. Easy walking distance to all the sights, very clean and beautifully furnished with all amenities necessary. Gianluca was very friendly and helpful, and the checkin/out went smoothly. The only inconsistency was that there was no parking on premises as stated in the description, but there was easy cheap parking on a near-by street. We would definitely recommend this place!"
342074,4823982,2017-03-06T10:58:21Z,"Great host, wonderful home. Highly recommended! "
342074,51283956,2016-11-01T07:31:55Z,"We had an absolutely amazing stay in Lecce!! The apartment is beautiful, clean and comfortable.  All the amenities you could need are provided and Marco (Gianluca's co-host) was simply incredible.  He met us upon our arrival and took the time to walk us around the city pointing out important sites to see and recommending places to eat and things to do.  We have never had an Airbnb host that was so willing to share their time and knowledge.  We appreciated that gesture immensely!!
The apartment is literally 2 minutes walk to the very center of Lecce and could not be more perfect. We really fell in love with Lecce - it has so much to offer, the city is small enough to comfortably walk everywhere and the people are warm and wonderful!! We will absolutely recommend this apartment to our friends and family and can't wait to return again! Thank you Marco and Gianluca!"
342074,25445427,2016-10-26T06:24:36Z,"The stay at Marco's place was just fain. He was very lovely host , explain as everything about the city and help us with all we needed. The flat was just like the photos , cozy and warm. That was the best choice for our trip."
342074,4979288,2016-10-12T06:51:16Z,"We felt at once at home at the appartment. It's centrally located, just a few steps from the historic centre and so comfi you could also spend a whole day there.. The appartement is styled very tastefully. 
While we were there Marco welcomed us in a perfect and also warm hearted way. He even showed us around in the historic centre which we appreciated much and was very helpful.
Highly recommended!
"
342074,21369037,2016-10-06T07:38:52Z,"I was looking for somewhere to have a relaxing time for a few days with my husband. The beautiful pictures on AB&B attracted me but I knew nothing of Lecce.
It proved to be the best choice! The apartment really is beautiful! It is very much in the Salento/Lecce style with a comfortable bed and adequate bathing and cooking facilities  under the most beautiful Lecce stone ceiling! 
It is a short walk to everything you would want to see in the historic centre of Lecce with good restaurants serving the local Puglia cuisine and Salento wine very close by. 
The hospitality was amazing! We chose to be picked up from Brindisi Airport by the service offered. We were in Lecce within 25 mins of landing, shown the apartment, followed by a short walk to become familiar with the surroundings! We have to thank Marco for his great care and attention to make sure we were comfortable and happy. 
It really was a great way to discover Lecce and the beautiful coast of Puglia. October was perfect timing! 
Thank you."
342074,22774073,2016-10-01T00:51:58Z,"I stayed at the apartment for one week in September and as a girl staying alone the apartment was exactly as described in the pictures.  It was a short walk away from the centre with lots of places to eat and drink.  Upon arrival Gianluca met me at the airport as promised and upon arrival at the apartment showed me around.  Gianluca even dropped by to check that everything was okay two days into my stay and introduced me to his friend Marco, who took me back to the airport after my weeks stay.

I thoroughly recommend this apartment and will definitely be returning.  I have even recommended to some friends who are keen to visit. "
342074,61190352,2016-09-23T00:27:03Z,"Gianluca was a wonderful host and the apartment is beautiful.   The location is ideal, being at the edge of the historic Lecce center.   That meant we could park close to the apartment but still only be a few steps from wherever we wanted to go.   We had a great experience and will stay there again when we return.  "
342074,14677467,2016-09-15T07:57:24Z,"Our stay in Lecce was amazing! We were greeted with open arms by Gianluca and his sweet lady. They were very helpful in locating all the top restaurants, bars, scenery, historical landmarks, and beaches. What a lovely couple! The house was just beautiful and right in the center of Lecce. The decor was very tasteful and classy. Such a clean and cozy environment that we'd definitely recommend! "
342074,20111781,2016-09-13T07:41:31Z,"Wow - Gianluca is perhaps the best Airbnb host I have ever had. I came to Lecce for a destination wedding. He was so nice, welcoming, helpful, and friendly.  He was there to meet me at the train station, helped me when I needed anything, the space was pristine and beautiful (we had lots of rain in Lecce at this time, and other friends in Airbnbs there had slugs etc.), and perfectly located to the center of town.  I would definitely stay there again. "
342074,17030262,2016-09-10T07:22:41Z,We had a great time in Gianluca`s house! The location was perfect and the hosts told us good restaurants and important informations about the city. Every room was lovely decorated and we enjoyed especially the exceptional architecture.
342074,89100,2016-09-02T00:17:21Z,"We had the most fantastic stay at Gianluca's place in Lecce. We were welcomed by Gianluca with a bottle of wine, some tips for our visit and restaurant recommendations. The place itself is amazing - we felt as though we were staying in a page from a design magazine. We'd love to visit again soon. Thanks Gianluca : ) "
342074,18864310,2016-08-28T02:28:07Z,"Gianluca était extrêmement prévenant et nous a fait sentir comme chez nous!
Nous avons adoré notre séjour à Lecce, ville vraiment très belle.
Tout était parfait


"
342074,65573536,2016-08-16T07:06:43Z,"Our stay in lecce was perfect.
The place is very well located clean and very cosy. 
Gianluca is a perfect host. Very welcoming and available. 
If we have to comeback in lecce, it definitely will in this place! 
Very highly recommended ! "
342074,55792497,2016-08-06T00:28:00Z,"Gianluca provided a warm and friendly welcome to my husband and I. The house was very well maintained, clean, and centrally located. We also got a lot of use out of the tour guides he has provided in the house - and Gianluca was also helpful in providing great advice on a road trip we did down the coast. When we got a parking ticket, Gianluca even helped us to seamlessly pay for it on his app! We would definitely stay here again. As a tip to future guests arriving in the summer, if you wish to have the house cool during the night we recommend not waiting until the evening to turn on the A/C - turn it on as soon as you arrive so that the bedroom has a chance to cool down before nighttime."
342074,7213073,2016-07-19T08:19:05Z,"Beautiful apartment in a great location, close to lots of excellent cafes and restaurants. The hosts were very welcoming, accommodating and helpful."
434469,83750799,2017-05-09T13:11:33Z,"We really enjoyed our stay in this unique Airstream! Trevor guided us up the hill to the accomodation and showed us around. He really wanted to make our stay perfect, and he succeeded :-) Communication was super easy and he was always up for good advices regarding the area. A car is a must for this place, because it's a few kilometers up the hill from Alozaina. But you can park it directly on the property which is fenced-in. The area is good for hiking and visiting the small towns nearby, as well as Ronda with its famous bridge! But we also enjoyed half a day just relaxing in the hammocks :-) Definitely a recommendation! We hope to come back one day!"
434469,125040564,2017-04-21T11:43:09Z,"Prachtige locatie, mooie route om bij de airstream te komen. Eigenaar heeft gedacht aan zitplekken op verschillende locaties zodat je op elk moment van de dag van de zon kunt genieten. Leuke hond van de eigenaar die af en toe bij je komt buurten. Trevor was een goede gastheer en heeft ervoor gezorgd dat wij een prettig verblijf hebben gehad."
434469,22467424,2017-04-18T19:16:28Z,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
434469,35976734,2017-04-16T08:19:02Z,"Everything was great!

The place is much better than what we saw in the pictures. Very clean, quiet and cozy. We had a magical experience there. 

The van is full of details and has everything that's necessary. Lots of intimacy and at the same time, you can rely on Trevor and Frances for everything you might need. 

The environment was beautiful and Frances massages are simply out of this world. 

We didn't want to leave. 

100% worth it!!"
434469,71053836,2016-12-31T07:27:34Z,"We had a great few days exploring the mountains and lakes in the area. Highly recommend going to the highest mountain ""Miradors""."
434469,21598815,2016-10-28T08:06:34Z,"Our stay at Trevor's place has been absolutely marvelous! It's an experience we recommend to everybody! Everything was made for our holidays to be great, thanks Trevor!"
434469,78134082,2016-10-22T01:58:34Z,"Amazing! Nature, location, Airstream and especially the host family. Never breathed such good air. Everything perfect and beyond our expectations. We will definitely come back! Thank you so much for this incredible experience!
Irina & Jay"
434469,11839382,2016-10-02T04:21:03Z,"Trevor ist ein entspannter Gastgeber, der uns genau das geboten hat, was wir gesucht haben. Die Ruhe und die friedliche Freiheit der ganzen Gegend hat uns überzeugt. Wir hatten wunderbare Tage in seinem fantastischen Airstream! Es gibt alles, was man braucht. Und mehr. 
Für Hilfe und Fragen ist Trevor immer parat. Und Norman, sein Hund, ist uns echt ans Herz gewachsen. "
434469,36724911,2016-09-17T02:45:50Z,"Due to last minute problems at our end, we had to cancel. But I'm going to finish this review which will mean leaving answers that are not entirely true, but it's the only way to get across just how helpful Trevor was throughout the whole booking process. He then helped with a string of queries I threw at him. It's important for potential visitors to know what a great host he is"
434469,3163360,2016-08-22T00:17:27Z,"Lovely place! Perfect for chilling out after exploring the area. Easy drive to Malaga, Ronda and lake Ardeles and El Chorro. The airstream has everything you need. The plunge pool is perfect for cooling off on really hot days. Trevor was easy to communicate with and gave us a warm welcome! "
434469,54826710,2016-07-25T05:47:21Z,"Wir hatten das Glück, noch relativ kurzfristig einen Platz im Airstream-Traum buchen zu können. Nach dem fünftägigen Kurzurlaub lautet unser Urteil: der Glamping-Urlaub in Alozaina hat unsere Erwartungen übertroffen und wird bestimmt in der Zukunft wieder eine Reise wert sein! Ruhe (mal von den Grillen abgesehen), Comfort und eine überdurchschnittlich große Gastfreundlichkeit (uns wurde bei allen technischen und geografischen Problemen geholfen und wir hatten nette Unterhaltungen) haben uns überzeugt! 
Ausgehend vom Wohnwagen kann man mit dem Auto tolle Ausflüge z.B. nach Ronda oder an die natürlichen Badeseen machen (eigentlich lohnt sich jede Fahrt!), oder aber die Tage am Pool und in der Hängematte verbringen. 
Man benötigt kein großes Gepäck, da man alles Notwendige (z.B. Handtücher) im Wohnwagen oder im nahegelegenen Supermarkt findet. 
In Anlehnung an die anderen Beiträge haben wir folgende Erfahrung gemacht: auch ein Kleinwagen (wir wurden von einem Fiat 500c ""unterstützt"") bringt einen gut zum Ziel, wenn auch etwas langsamer und in bestimmten Streckenabschnitten im ersten Gang :-)...da wurde unser zentrales Ziel des Urlaubs ""Entspannung"" bereits beim Autofahren umgesetzt! 

Wir freuen uns auf ein Wiedersehen!! :-)"
434469,33256252,2016-07-10T02:04:35Z,Trevor welcomed us at the airstream and showed us around. We had everything we needed at the airstream and enjoyed our stay there. It was clean and much bigger than it looks from the outside. His Dog Norman came by a couple times and it was fun playing with him. The nature around is awesome and you can explore a lot of different things just within a one hour drive. We can definitly recomend to stay there!
434469,13860580,2016-06-28T00:27:07Z,"Trevor war ein großartiger Gastgeber und war immer da wenn man ihn gebraucht hat. Sonst hatte man an diesem idyllischen Ort einfach Zeit zu entspannen und seine absolute Privatsphäre. Norman (der Haushund) hat dort unsere Zeit zusätzlich versüßt. Ihr findet in dem Wohnwagen alles, was Ihr braucht und einkaufen könnt Ihr mit dem Auto nur in 3 Minuten den Berg runter! Wir können den Aufenthalt nur Empfehlen und wir werden auf jeden Fall nächstes Jahr wiederkommen. Danke Trevor für diese wundervolle Zeit bei Dir!

"
434469,3413378,2016-06-11T02:07:45Z,"De Airstream staat op een prachtige rustige plek, midden in de natuur. Maar wel veilig, de plek is omheind en door een poort met eigen sleutel kom je er. De Airstream zelf is in 1 woord: perfect! Van alle gemakken voorzien en heel ruim. Ook airconditioning 2 fan's in de Airstream. De bbq en eigen pool maken het compleet. Veel privacy want veel ruimte ter beschikking. Trevor is zeer gastvrij: jij begeleidt je de eerste keer vanuit de plaats Alozaina naar de Airstream ( is maar 2 km maar best lastig te vinden). Hij vertelt vol trots over de Airstream en hij geeft goede tips over mooie dingen te doen in de omgeving zoals ronda , El torcal en mooie meren in de buurt om te zwemmen bij ardales. Trevor woont naast de Airstream dus als er iets kun je snel bij hem terecht. En dan de hond NOrman: een geweldig grappige en lieve hond die zo nu en dan eens komt kijken. Wij vonden deze ervaring 1 om nooit te vergeten en als we een weekje de stress willen ontvluchten is dit de plek om te zijn. Trevor, bedankt...."
434469,38275005,2015-11-17T11:12:23Z,"I can't recommend this enough. I don't think I'm clever enough to find the words to truly describe this wonderfully unique experience. We spent 3 amazing nights here. The Airstream is something unique that has to be experienced. It has everything. The bed is so comfortable you won't fail to get a good night sleep. The location, wow. Set 3/4 away up a track up in to the mountains in a small little community surrounded by both orange and olive trees it's both scenic and peaceful. The clear evening sky allowed us to sit on the deck each night and state in to the planetarium like sky. The hosts friendly and welcoming always with a smile on their face - well you would if you lived up here. Honestly if you stay here it will be amazingly unique. We certainly won't forget our stay."
434469,12955178,2015-10-09T11:08:48Z,The caravan is exactly what it looks like on the pictures. The surroundings are amazing. Trevor is friendly and easy to communicate with. 
434469,16794760,2015-09-29T12:18:04Z,"Hemos pasado unos días maravillosos días en este lugar a finales de septiembre y puedo confirmar que la elección fue todo un acierto. Soy amante del mundo del camping y las caravanas, y esta Airstream cautiva.

Estar en este alojamiento es sinónimo de descanso, de relax, de placeres para los sentidos. Naturaleza y sensación de libertad... Para mi más que suficiente para lo que pretendía que fueran esos días de vacaciones.

El dueño es de lo más agradable, dispuesto y atento. Vive en la parcela colindante, pero sólo nos visitó cuando lo necesitamos. Es discreto, pero también es muy hablador si es lo que buscas, así que disfrutamos con placer de su conversación (en inglés) y su compañía.

El equipamiento es bastante completo, había ropa de cama y toallas, así como todo lo de primera necesidad (incluso algunas cosas en el frigorífico). Como preferíamos aprovechar el día para estar fuera, hacíamos sólo cenas y desayunos en la caravana, pero que placer era aprovechar todo ese espacio exterior tan bien equipado. Tumbonas colgantes, barbacoa a gas, varias zonas donde sentarse a la mesa, sol, sombra... ¡Y la minipiscina! helada eso sí, pero tras las caminatas de varias horas por los alrededores y a 27 grados, os aseguro que era un verdadero placer darse un chapuzón y que ese frescor permaneciera durante un buen rato conmigo.

El acceso desde el pueblo no es complicado, el camino, aunque estrecho y a ratos muy empinado, está hormigonado y se llega al sitio en menos de 10 minutos, eso sí, en segunda velocidad y llevando el motor bien alegre. Trevor te acompaña desde el pueblo en su vehículo, así que no hay pérdida posible.

En la ronda exterior del pueblo hay un supermercado grande, gasolinera y el restaurante ""El Mirador"", que haber de viernes a domingo y donde se come muy bien a precios moderados.

Si se vuelven a alinear los astros, repetiremos con placer esta experiencia.
"
434469,19177517,2015-09-15T11:12:43Z,"Our 3 days in the Airstream caravan was a very relax and needed break. Our host Trevor was most welcoming and showed us around happily. He paid us regular visits just to have a ""chat"" which was a nice touch and was very happy to share information about the surrounding areas to visit and pubs and restaurants where drinks and  good food were served. We loved the fact that the location was quite secluded from passersby, quiet and close to the hills. The caravan had all the needed equipment described, and very comfortable too. The Village of Alozaina is also very pretty and the locals were incredibly welcoming and chatty. We were lucky to arrive on a festive weekend where the ""Aceituna"" was celebrated, with local bands / food stores and Flamenco dancers. All what you can expect from a region like Andalucia ;-). You can also visit the picturesque little town of RONDA which is around 45KM from Alozaina, and the way there offers the most breathtaking landscape.

We do recommend you try this alternative type of stay; we were really sad to leave, but I believe we will come back if Trevor allows us to ;-)."
434469,27653042,2015-09-08T16:25:17Z,Amazing! Trevor & Fran are perfect hosts! What a wonderful experience 10/10! We will be back :)
434469,35630125,2015-07-08T14:21:51Z,"Es una oportunidad única poder disfrutar de una caravana Airstream, no solo por su estética sino también por todas las comodidades que ofrece en su interior. Ha sido una experiencia genial, hemos podido disfrutar de la naturaleza y el relax que ofrece el paraje y de la amabilidad y generosidad de nuestro anfitrión,Trevor. Sin duda repetiremos."
403641,28133935,2017-05-02T08:21:10Z,"Great place! This is an old house, supposedly with a 400 year history, so perhaps expect a floor board to squeak or a light fixture to blink. But it is an absolute pearl: the view over the river and the magnificent pool in the foreground, room for at least 8 people (and more if you wish to sleep outside in a hammock), and just about everything you would want for your own home. The kitchen has more plates and utensils than you can count, spices and oil, everything to do your own cooking, and the grill outside can be used with available firewood. There is a separate laundry room if you must wash clothes, you can pick oranges off the trees and make juice, you can get eggs from the chickens and make an omelet, it's truly country living. The owners really do spoil you by bringing some food and a sip of Porto wine upon arrival and they are so nice and accommodating. When the water went out one day it only took an hour for someone to arrive from the city of Porto and fix it to get us back in business. Alberto and Maria will stay out of your way if you wish or you can chat with them and learn all about the house and the area. If you are without car, you can reach Sebolido by bus from Porto in 50 minutes and the house is only a few minutes downhill from the bus stop (uphill with your suitcase on the way back…). The local super market is no more than a 10 minute walk and has most of the necessities and food, but don't expect gourmet local specialties, yet the people in the store are also very helpful and nice. There are not really any restaurants in town, only a few local bars or coffee shops, but taxi service is available to nearby towns if needed. However, come to Sebolido for a relaxing time and if the weather is on your side, enjoy the pool with infinity view over the river and the Douro valley. Do be aware that a warm sunny day can change rapidly into a cool and windy night, but that's what makes grapes produce great wine! We had a splendid reunion with 8 friends and could not have picked a better place."
403641,9909451,2017-04-04T08:17:19Z,"Wow, this house is just amazing! Very quiet and peaceful. Maria and her husband are very friendly. Everthing else is like descripted - we did not miss anything."
403641,46367792,2017-01-29T08:03:00Z,"I loved the house! Beautiful, well maintained and clean. Alberto is an amazing host!  I was not lucky with the weather. It was too cold, and the house lacks a modern heating system, and a small problem with the water heater made us leave the house 2 nights earlier. Other than that, I loved this house and I strongly recommend it. "
403641,90905860,2016-10-22T09:30:12Z,"We hebben een heerlijke vakantie gehad in Quinta da Moura. Het begon al bij de geweldig gastvrije ontvangst en alle heerlijkheden die voor ons waren klaargezet. Eerst kregen we een rondleiding door het huus en niet te vergeten door de schitterende tuin.  Het is een prachtige verbouwde boerderij, met veel originele details zoals een wijnpers etc. wat een heerlijk huis, heerlijk zwembad en prachtig uitzicht. Ook 's avonds als alle lichtjes aan gingen op de berg tegenover ons. We hebben heerlijk buiten kunnen eten en veel gebruik gemaakt van de barbecue. 'S Avonds staken we ook vaak de open haard aan."
403641,6022844,2016-09-25T00:16:42Z,"Maria & Alberto were so helpful, friendly and made us feel very welcome. They took time to explain everything to us, showed us around and surprised us with some cheeses and fresh fruits & vegetables from the garden.

The house & garden were amazing. Really lovely when you want to relax and get away from it all. The view was mesmerizing. We were lucky that lots of the fruits & vegetables were ripe and that we were allowed to pick what we wanted to use. 

We were there with our daughter (toddler) and she also absolutely loved it. Especially the daily trips to see Rosa (the pig) and the sheep. They also had a baby crip, chair, cups, cutlery etc at the house which was great.

"
403641,30428620,2016-09-18T01:29:03Z,"We had a wonderful holiday in this house.
An interesting building, set in beautiful gardens with an outstanding view and lovely swimming pool.
The hosts Maria and Alberto are charming and generous.
"
403641,8383430,2016-09-10T10:08:58Z,"Estancia perfecta en un lugar ideal. Tanto Alberto como Maria nos hicieron sentir como en casa.
La casa dispone de todas las comodidades y el exterior esta muy cuidado con una piscina fantastica para relajarte.
En definitiva, una experiencia genial"
403641,54338050,2016-09-05T03:44:28Z,"C'était un séjour magnifique ! encore plus beau que sur les photos !
Maria et Alberto sont adorables et nous ont super bien accueillis avec en surprise de quoi se restaurer en arrivant …
La maison est magnifique, de beaux matériaux et très bien décorée..
Le réveil le matin avec vue sur la piscine et la vallée du Douro …le top pour bien démarrer la journée !
Trop envie d'y retourner …….!!!!!!!!"
403641,9908100,2016-07-31T03:33:32Z,"We never felt as welcome as here. Maria and Alberto showed us around and provided bread, water, soft drinks, cheese, meat, fresh fruit and pastel de nata. The house and the garden are wonderful, the swimming pool is awesome. The view is breathtaking. The kitchen is very well equipped. On the terrace there is a hammock and the garden is full of little pretty corners. We enjoyed the fresh oranges from the garden and the fresh eggs from the chickens. In the little supermarket nearby we could find everything we needed. It is a little paradise!"
403641,1876959,2016-07-10T02:57:25Z,"Vi blev simpelthen hentet i lufthavnen ved midnatstid! Fantastisk service. Meget meget søde værter. Jeg har længe tænkt over hvordan jeg kan anbefale dette sted. Alt er beskrevet så fint af tidligere gæster. Jeg vil prøve ikke at gentage det..
Stedet er simpelthen fantastisk! Vi rejste specifikt til Portugal pga huset, og vi blev bestemt ikke skuffede. Omgivelserne er så smukke at man ikke har lyst til at forlade stedet. Hele haven er i park størrelse og man kan bruge lang tid på at plukke frugt og se på blomster. Vi nød friske æg og lavede selv appelsin juice. Alt er ekstremt velholdt.
Der er ingen synlige naboer, men alligevel kun et par hundrede meter til den lokale café, samt indkøbs mulighed. 
Poolen er top lækker og det føles behageligt ikke at gå i klorvand. 
Når man ser billederne af huset indvendigt kunne man tro at det villle være umuligt at holde rent. Hvis man kunne rate rengøringen til mere end fem stjerne ville jeg gøre det. Alt er rent og der er ingen små dyr indenfor. Dejlig køligt indenfor og masser af plads. Vi var 7 personer. Vores fem børn var også meget tilfredse med internet hastigheden. "
403641,30171405,2016-07-02T00:37:55Z,"Paradise on earth! Alberto and Maria's stunning property is the perfect place to completely relax and unwind. The view, the pool, the grounds are even more spectacular than in the photos. The gorgeous stone house and side chapel were surrounded by beautiful flowering bushes and trees everywhere, and the grounds are exceptionally well maintained. So much colour and beauty at every turn! We loved being able to walk amongst the lemon and orange trees, to stop in and see the pig, sheep, chickens, chicks and roosters and to visit the orchid greenhouse all onsite! It was also the first time we saw kiwi vines! 

Maria and Alberto were the perfect hosts, kind, generous and with many great recommendations on the area. They welcomed us into their home with a wonderful spread of food, including a full fruit basket, pastries, pastel de nata, cheeses, wine... We hope to return to their lovely spot one day and for a longer stay! Thank you Maria and Alberto for exactly the vacation we needed out in the fresh air, surrounded by so much natural beauty!"
403641,13230428,2016-05-08T01:36:57Z,"At our arrival, we were warmly welcomed by Alberto and Maria, the sweetest persons ever that received us in the friendliest way and took time for us to explain the place! Bread, cheese, fruits, fresh eggs from the chicken of the cottage on the table, typical ‘Portuguese table’! Lovely lovely people! And then the place… in a word: a dream! The pictures already showed us how the place could be attractive, but the reality in beyond this, it is just an amazingly gorgeous place, so beautiful that you hardly want to go out, many corners all touched with attention with beautiful flowers everywhere, fruit trees that we could enjoy the delicious juice at the morning and the view, breathtaking view at the river Douro with the swimming pool—very well appreciated with salty water! Just gorgeous! And then comes the house in itself, fantastically renovated, again every room is beautiful with antic objects chosen with taste and love, it is like everything found its place there! A lot of space and beautiful, nothing was missing and in this ambiance we felt immediately bewitched! One week was surely not enough and we could have spent much much longer time! When we could extract ourselves from this gorgeous place, the surroundings are also very interesting and beautiful to explore, very well situated, close to Porto city, charming villages, nice nature. I can expand writing about the place and Alberto and Maria but surely it will be a destination for us again in the future and the five stars are surely not enough!!"
403641,3193956,2015-11-15T10:47:17Z,"Alberto & Maria were great hosts. Alberto welcomed us very warmly and showed us the premises when we arrived. We were greeted with a great selection of fresh local products ranging from port vine to croissants. Alberto was also very helpful and courteous: He even gave us a lift on one night to a nearby restaurant.

The villa itself was gorgeous: views were absolutely stunning, opening up to the Douro river. We spent almost half our time in the area just by enjoying the views from the sun deck. Every now and then we went to the garden to pick an orange or see the local farm animals.

From inside the house was charming and very clean. The house had all necessary amenities from internet to washing machine (+ some extras like jacuzzi).

All in all, our company of 5 people really enjoyed our stay in Quinta do Moura and we would come back here any day! I'd give this place six stars if I could."
403641,24532078,2015-10-03T11:25:49Z,"We were made to feel at home by a very warm & pleasant welcoming from Maria & her husband. They spent a long time in acquainting us with the house & it's appliances, the garden, where to visit during our 6 day stay & where to eat.
They very kindly left us enough food & necessities to make our stay even more pleasurable.
The house was so good that we cooked at home 4 nights to enjoy eating on the porch overlooking the fabulous pool & the Douro river. We spent two great days exploring Porto, one day in the lovely small town of Amarante,the Schistvillage of Ermelo & the waterfall above the town. The road to Ermelo is not for the faint hearted.
Another day at the fabulous old town of Guimaraes which we really enjoyed.
Also had a great day in Braga & on to the amazing Bom Jesus Church.
The house is full of interesting collections from all over the world & the garden has plants very similar to what would be in our Western Australian gardens. Both the house & garden are beautiful & the pool, lighting & collection of artefacts make a stay here one of the highlights of Portugal.
We would love to return one day & will highly recommend Quinta da Moura as a must visit."
403641,23711257,2015-09-14T11:18:18Z,"The most amazing farm stay looking onto the Douro River. We travelled as a family of 4 adults and 2 kids with our friends joining us with their 2 kids and baby. The kids loved feeding the animals, picking fruit to eat, discovering walks all over the farm. The house was a treasure trove of wares, from a fully equipped kitchen, toys for the boys, inflatables for the pool, baby foot football table for the bigger boys. We loved every moment and a great base to discover Amarante, Mateuse or just lazing by the pool. Many thanks for Alberto for giving us a tour of your beautiful home and even the welcome gift of fruit, bread, salami and beers in the fridge. Perfect place to enjoy the company of friends and family. Can't wait to come visit again. "
403641,21207875,2015-08-30T11:10:18Z,"La villa e' anche migliore di quello che si vede in foto. Un posto da sogno: la location e' mozzafiato, la piscina superlussuosa, il giardino lussureggiante e curatissimo, pieno di frutta pronta da cogliere.
Gli interni, molto suggestivi e personali, pieni di oggetti della vita dei proprietari, con un sacco di poltrone per rilassarsi, tavoli per mangiare, ed una cucina fornitissima.
L'accoglienza dei proprietari, magnifica: ci hanno fatto trovare ogni possibile ben di Dio: vini, frutta, dolci, di tutto di piu'! Consigliatissimo a tutti.
Unica piccola scomodita', come altri hanno notato: i letti matrimoniali sono piccoli (una piazza e mezza)"
403641,13412315,2015-08-23T11:04:56Z,"Quinta de Moura est un petit paradis terrestre ! Un endroit paisible, à l'abri de la vie urbaine, du bruit et des regards. Un lieu où il fait bon flâner, lire, dormir, contempler. La vue sur le Duro est belle et apaisante, la maison spacieuse et confortable, le verger luxuriant...à l'image de leurs hôtes adorables, généreux et attachants."
403641,5022571,2015-08-09T11:00:48Z,"Our holidays at Quinta da Moura were just as wonderfull than expected.
Maria and Alberto are such welcoming hosts asking us several times during our stay if we need anything.
And, as described in others comments, there have been hosting us at our arrival together with beers, bread, fruits from the garden and ... pasteis de nata.

The inside house is very comfortable, renovated and decorated tastefully. It's a bit dark but it is inherent from these traditional houses.
The outside is just amazing with a impressive view on the Douro from the terrace or the swimming pool. 

We were two families (4 adults/5 children from 4 to 9 years). 
The children enjoyed everything in the house : swimming pool obviously, picking up fresh eggs every morning, bringing back fruits and vegetables from the garden, playing soccer table, building huts in the garden...
We, the parents, were very happy to be mainly lazing next to the  pool, going for a cafe at the bar juste above the house or enjoying the view from the terrace.

The house is located along the Douro in the countryside but only 35' from Porto, 25' from Penafiel, 15' from Castelo de Paiva, nice small city on the other side of the Douro where you can find cafes shops and supermarkets (Lidl and Intermarché)

Some of our best experiences/memories during our holidays :
- visiting Porto and Gaia
- visiting Guimaraes
- spending an afternoon in Penafiel
- renting a boat for a full day (in Melres) on the Douro with water ski and buoy for the children
- buying cooked chicken along the road for the evening meal or the dish of the day at the restaurant in Rio Mau
- buying fresh bread and/or fish  at the vans coming every morning along the road (the baker is speaking french fluently...)
- tasting some red wines from the grocery just above the house
- ....

Thanks again to Maria and Alfredo for their kindness

You immediately feel at home. The house, the view, the pool; everything was beyond expectations. The house is located in a huge, very well maintained garden with animals, fruits and a lot of hidden corners (kids will love the garden)"

6383275,91836289,2017-02-20T01:06:23Z,Super place and ideal for a large party of people
6383275,71775593,2017-02-05T04:56:20Z,The staffs in the villa are really kind and hardworking. They provide a perfect holiday for us and we are really enjoy the days there.

6383275,28420011,2017-01-20T03:48:58Z,Amazing property just as described. Staff was very friendly and driver knew all the great spots on the island to take us. Highly recommend 
6383275,55994090,2017-01-03T00:25:21Z,"The villa is incredible! So much space, and all the special features such as gym, spa room, cinema room etc really make it a fantastic place to stay for a large group. The food cooked at the villa was really good and we actually ate there most of the time. Also very good value. The staff are also really helpful and always patient with us. Thomas and Mam really did a lot to make sure we were happy and arranged a special new year celebration for us with fireworks and decorations. All in all, a great place to stay, highly recommended. "
6383275,44240717,2016-12-12T04:51:53Z,"性價比可接受,但餐牌價錢較高及選擇少"
6383275,45127016,2016-12-02T01:43:33Z,"This is a good place for a relaxing holiday.  The photos and the description on web-site are the same as the real view.  We total 20 adults live in here.  We all love the swimming pool and the poolside dinning area very much.  The butler - Thomas was very helpful.  As we don't want to sleep on the bunk beds which for children, I've sent email to Thomas to arrange not to sleep on bunk beds.  As a result, the arrangement was good, my friend should sleep on a pull-out bed instead of bunk beds.  So, thanks Thomas very much.  The surprise birthday cake was good, as I asked Thomas to prepare before our arrival.  The Thai food (450b - 800b per person), no matter lunch or dinner, was very delicious, must try.  To us, Thai food was better than BBQ dinner.  For the in-house massage (800b per hour) was very comfortable and convenient.  You can spend a few days to enjoy this villa without getting out.  We love this villa very much. We hope can come again soon.   "
6383275,66527308,2016-11-11T01:38:52Z,"Great friendly staff, amazing views. A wonderful time with family and friends!"
6383275,16941777,2016-11-08T01:20:48Z,"It was amazing from check in to checkout.

The photos don't do the house justice, its spectacular.

We rented the villa for 6 nights for our close family and friends to celebrate our wedding.

We couldn't fault anything about it, the views, the food, the pool and the staff, especially Mem were amazing!"
6383275,5035075,2016-10-28T04:02:27Z,"mam and staff are wonderful and also very helpful. Breakfast was nice. The weather was great. Recommend to all groups/ family getaway.  The villa is at the hill top , so if need to mention for the groups that self-transport. Otherwise is wonderful. "
6383275,38473560,2016-10-27T02:36:52Z,"A group of 9 English 55 ish year olds stayed at Villa Amonteera from 23rd-26th October to get over our flight from London and acclimatise before the rest of our holiday in Thailand. The minibus was there to meet us at Phuket airport as arranged. The villa managers Jennifer and Mam could not have made us more welcome. The villa was even more beautiful than the photos on Airbnb. It was clean and the staff made us feel very welcome without always being around us. I fixed the menus with Mam and the chef on arrival,  and the food was fantastic and plentiful. Within half an hour of asking, we had 5 masseurs arrive at the spa area in the villa to give us massages. We also had a great Thai cooking lesson with the villa chef. The driver took us to Patong for an excursion, and to a private beach the following day. We had a fabulous 3 day stay, thank you so much! Can we come again!?!"

6383275,46911890,2016-10-05T00:48:18Z,"It was definitely a stunning villa but several matters that were not up to expectations. 
1. The cinema room was not available. The projector was not working which was sad as one of the main reasons we booked the villa was because of the cinema room
2. In the evenings when there are several people taking their shower, the hot water is not able to sustain its supply. Some ended up with a cold shower. 
3. There was some kind of condensation in the rooms. One of the kids slipped and fell, knocking his head on the floor as the floor was wet. "
6383275,68009233,2016-09-29T02:36:49Z,"與相片所看絕對相符,無一不同。我們10個人都一致認為今次旅程十分滿意。特別感謝經理Yu及Jennifer,她們對我地的要求都做到很好,特別是我們所需求的早餐,晚餐(BBQ,泰菜)都超級令我們意外驚喜。特別提及的是私人戲院不能使用因爲投射器損壞了,但房東都用其他方式去補償給我們,希望能令我們滿足整個旅程。
所有員工的服務態度都好好,每位的笑容都好親切。
下次到布吉,都會想再去的一間Villa"

742911,14514384,2017-05-01T08:43:29Z,"Leonardo's home is set atop a beautiful little village. It is a short walk to the supermarket, restaurant and train station. We had very relaxing days by the pool and would suggest for those who want to be immersed in Italian culture and small village life. "
742911,2442490,2017-04-28T06:04:32Z,"Wonderful place, and as adorable as the photos show. 
The view was amazing, and I wish we'd come for summer to enjoy some outdoor lounging by the pool.
Good communication, good directions (this was super important, as we were pretty groggy from all the flights), and an easy key hand-off."
742911,29528230,2017-04-26T12:39:59Z,"This is the perfect place for a few nights of relaxing in the Tuscan countryside. The flat is clean, comfy and has beautiful views from the balcony. Only downside was wifi only works in the kitchen, and remember the town is very small so the restaurant options are very limited. Other than that it's perfect. "
742911,65857303,2017-04-24T08:21:55Z,Everything was amazing and Leonardo was a great host. This is exactly what we pictured staying in Tuscany to be like. Would definitely come back again!
742911,21141496,2017-04-22T08:17:56Z,"The little house is very lovely and has everything you need. It is quite and charming. We loved it there! Thank you again, for a nice week!"
742911,12148091,2017-04-14T06:54:47Z,Leonardo is a great host. Very friendly and helpful. The apartment is very cozy and the view is stunning. Leonardo's place is located in a very nice and small village with great train connection to Firenze. The perfect place to experience Tuscany. 
742911,114645202,2017-04-10T06:10:39Z,"I can only highly recommend Leonardo's place. It is located in the beautiful Tuscan countryside (whilst still in walking distance to a train station) and it was very clean and accurate to the description given on the listing. Also, Leonardo and his family were very kind hosts! This has been one of my favourite AirBNB experiences to date and I hope to someday get the chance to stay at Leonardo's place again. Thanks Leonardo!"
742911,40444008,2016-12-02T07:57:33Z,"Though this may not be an actual Vineyard, it does give the feeling that you are imersd in the tuscan hills. The home has plenty of authentic decorations from grape presses and ground tillers to wood roofs and tile floors. You will feel right at home with all the amenities washer, stove,small fridge, heater for the winter and a very clean and functional bathroom. Though we had a car and were able to get around easily. There was a small pizza place owned by the brother, convenience store and dry cleaner all in walking distance. The Host we're amazing and Leonardo was very nice and informative and always answered all of our questions and messages quickly. To get more out of this area I would suggest having a car so you can see the beautiful churches and Vineyards nearby. Heads up most of the Vineyards here are by reservation only so plan ahead. If you are looking for a shopping destination this is a great spot as they have an outlet mall for all the high-end Brands Gucci, Prada, Ferragamo... I will definitely be telling my friends about this beautiful location cheers."
742911,43975118,2016-10-14T07:38:21Z,"Unbelievable stay in the tuscan hills.

First, let me just say that Leonardo and his family are very nice and gracious hosts. 

We were able to check in hours before our actual check in time, and although we didn't meet Leonardo right away, his sister and father were very kind and showed us around the property and made sure we were set.

The view is spectacular, and the village is super quant.

My wife and I did not have a car our whole stay, and we just used the train into the city as the station is just a short walk away from the property.

If you do stay, I recommend exploring the village, and staying around Thursday to the weekend because there is a little market fair that happens Thursday morning I think."
742911,18135179,2016-10-08T08:08:10Z,Staying at Leonardo ' place was a real experience into an old tuscan country home. With all modern facilities. House was cozy and fully furnished plus extra Clean.  The view and silence a total plus. Definitely coming another time.
742911,31476804,2016-10-06T01:44:53Z,"A physically stunning atmosphere in a lovely Tuscan Village. The owner's AirbNB unit is Solid with Top-Notch Quality craftsmanship that oozes Tuscan charm. In addition, the view of the Valley is unparalleled coupled with the superb pool and garden area adjoining the unit.

I enjoyed the Village of Regnano and its friendly citizens. A great bakery/coffee shop, great grocery Co-op and picturesque houses, it looks like it is straight out of a postcard. 

The proximity by train to Florence was perfect and allowed the best of both worlds. 25-30 minutes by Train and you are in the heart of Florence.

The downside of the experience was that we felt pressured to leave. It became very uncomfortable that each time we had a conversation the only topic raised was, ""When are you leaving? I have paying customers (which we were also) coming and need it to be free so it can be cleaned.""

There wasn't conversation around how our trip was or any friendly conversation that we would expect as someone in the hospitality service treating a paying customer.

What had been a flawless Holiday became very stressful and uncomfortable.

The views were amazing, the pool was so cool to escape the heat, the little house was perfect! It was in the hills but close enough to to the village that was so quite and quant. This was exactly what we were expecting to find in Tuscany! We will definitely stay here again to get this wonderful view and feel of the rolling Tuscany hills! Thank you Leonardo for this wonderful experience! "
742911,20746250,2016-09-21T09:54:21Z,"Leonardos Häuschen ist wirklich gemütlich und liegt sehr idyllisch auf einem Hügel in der kleinen Stadt Rignano S.A.. Vom Bahnhof läuft man etwa 5-10 Minuten bergauf und durch den kleinen öffentlichen Park direkt vor dem Anwesen von Leonardos Familie. Dieses ist groß, typisch Toskanisch und hat einen tollen Garten und nicht zu vergessen, einen schönen Pool mit grandioser Aussicht! Obwohl es bei uns nicht ganz so warm war, waren wir einmal im Wasser ;) 
Das ""Strettoio"" selbst ist perfekt ausgestattet mit allem, was man braucht! Küche mit allen Kochutensilien (auch Öl, Salz etc), ein großes Bad, (meistens) einwandfrei funktionierendes Wifi, mehrere verschiedene Decken für das Bett (welches wir übrigens nicht zu klein fanden) und sogar einer Waschmaschine + Wäscheständer - gerade für uns, genau in der Mitte unserer 2-wöchigen Italien-Rundreise perfekt! :)
In Rignano selbst gibt es nicht viel zu tun (außer in 30 Minuten nach Florenz zu fahren :P) , aber man hat trotzdem alles Notwendige - Bank, Post, Bäcker, Supermarkt, Eisdiele und das Restaurant von Leonardos Bruder natürlich, wo es sehr leckere und günstige Pizzen gibt!
Leonardo selbst hat uns sehr freundlich empfangen; er hat auch einen kleinen Ordner mit allen nötigen Infos (z.B. Züge nach Florenz) im Apartment - sehr gut organisiert! :)
Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen - dann aber wahrscheinlich mit dem Auto zum Erkunden der Toskana und nicht nur zum Entspannen nach einer Woche Mailand & Florenz... ;) "
742911,14510849,2016-09-20T11:08:50Z,"We had a lovely stay at Leonardo's. The villa was clean and well-equipped, and the pool and views were wonderful. Perfect place for some respite from the hustle and bustle of Florence! My only advice would be to bring insect repellent as I did get bitten a lot while I was there."
742911,32944589,2016-09-16T07:06:44Z,"Hi Leonardo
We enjoyed our stay at your place and the day outs in Florence. 
The garden area with the pool was absolutely great. Wished the bed was a bit bigger, as a couple we felt like not having enough space.

Kind regards 
Dominique & Rachel "
742911,50204779,2016-09-11T09:27:44Z,Leonardo's house was absolutely beautiful. It was a great relaxing few days in between tough traveling. We had everything we needed there and felt very comfortable. Leonardo and his family were very friendly and the town was cute. There is not much to do in town but walking around was nice when it cooled off. I would definitely come back. Only a 30 min train to Florence too if you need more activity. 
742911,183236,2016-09-10T03:15:48Z,"This is the third time we have been back to Leonardo's place and it's still fantastic. He is a great host and makes sure you have everything you need.
Would highly recommend staying here."
742911,492874,2016-08-31T03:45:45Z,"Wonderful cosy place to stay with everything you need for a relaxing holiday in Tuscany.
Leonardo is a very helpful and considerate person, making sure we had everything we needed.
Stunning place and the pool was perfect for those hot summer days. 
Close to the shops and as we had hired a car it was lots of fun to go visit vineyards in the region.
We will certainly be back again. "
742911,71537751,2016-08-28T08:04:39Z,"Bij aankomst moesten we even zoeken naar het goede huis. Gelukkig konden de buren ons de weg wijzen. We werden goed ontvangen door Leonardo. Meteen een hele uitleg met wat tips.  Het viel ons heel erg mee dat we zo met de trein naar Florance konden en dat we met vijf minuten in het dorpje waren, dat overigens niet heel levendig was. Één  supermarkt, één bakkerij, één apotheek en één restaurantje die dicht was wegens vakantietijd. Het huisje was idyllisch maar wel klein.  Het bed was voor 2 vriendinnen te klein, gelukkig stond er een uit klapbare bank in de woonkamer. Het zwembad was heerlijk! We hebben er heerlijke dagen aan gelegen me een mooi uitzicht! "
742911,9022257,2016-08-23T01:17:26Z,"Leonardo is the perfect Host! Really kind and explains everything. The house is complete and very romantic. Balcony, close to swimming pool and very nice decoration. The place is beatifull and the view is amazing. Also the trainstation to Florence is very close (walking distance) and you have to take the train to Florence, not the car. Leonardo has also lot of information for to do, a big help. 
Parking is easy and the place is very quit. If you go to Toscany, absolutly visit this place. Thank you Leonarde for being an amazing host for us, we have enjoyed our days very very much! "
49508,122005068,2017-05-09T09:38:53Z,Todo excelente excepto un poco de ruido por las noches y el estado del edificio. El apartamento mejor de lo que pensaba. Lo recomiendo.
49508,22980807,2017-05-01T13:38:34Z,"Antonio's apartment is a rare gem, very comfortable and in full Sicilian style, it felt like being in a painting by Guttuso. The location was great with with a large selection of bars and restaurants just ""down the stairs"" and close to the main attractions and the seafront.
We really loved the decorated ceramics throughout the apartment made by the local artists and the happy feel they exude.
The host welcomed us warmly, gave us insider's tips on Palermo and the best places locals go to and arranged transport for us even though he had little/no notice of our arrival.

Definitely recommended!!"
49508,7312835,2017-04-27T09:06:45Z,"L'appartement d'Antonio est très bien placé, plein de charme, et bien plus calme que ce qu'on pourrait supposer pour un appartement au coeur de la vieille ville. Antonio est très accueillant, chaleureux, attentif, intéressant. Il donne toute sorte de très bons conseils pour découvrir Palerme. Nous n'avons pas eu de difficultés à nous garer sur le Foro Italico, à 5 mn à pied. Nous garderons un excellent souvenir de notre séjour !"
49508,11803836,2017-04-20T08:16:23Z,"If faded grandeur is your thing, Antonio's is the place for you. Perfectly positioned to explore the old city, the apt is comfortable and comes fully equipped. Highly recommended *****"
49508,73504571,2017-04-02T08:21:16Z,"Fantastic and very charming apartment in a great location to experience Palermo. Antonio was a great host ,very friendly and helpful. Thank you for a very special experience. "
49508,5159318,2017-03-24T10:18:05Z,"A fascinating place. Exactly as described and reviewed.  Decaying opulence, but with Antonio's wonderful presence."
49508,65732338,2017-03-11T10:24:12Z,"The palazzo catolico is a fantastic place to stay - both a great location for exploring the old town as well as being a lovely apartment, beautifully decorated. Antonio was extremely helpful throughout our stay and was a great host!"
49508,61838251,2017-02-26T08:21:24Z,"Un petit appartement très charmant, idéalement situé, des informations pratiques pour savoir où aller manger, où sortir. Tout était parfait. Merci Antonio. Nous reviendrons c'est certain."
49508,82498325,2017-02-18T07:09:32Z,"Fantastic place to stay and explore Palermo. The apartment is close to the sights, restaurants and cafes. It is a magnificent building with an excellent balcony and terrace. We could not recommend the apartment more highly.  "
49508,71090549,2017-02-12T10:40:26Z,Beautiful apartment in a great location! Would definitely stay here again. 
49508,10583319,2017-02-07T08:12:45Z,"Staying in Antonio's apartment is a bit like visiting the home of a very interesting uncle, whose collection of much-loved objects is a reflection of a full life. 

You cannot beat the location. We were quite happy with the centrality of his place, the ease at going to the supermarket nearby, and the general feel of the neighborhood. As others have noted, the many steps up are a reminder of another time, and the graciousness of the architecture was wonderful. 

Meeting up with Tiziana, who let us in, was easy and very amiable. Since Antonio was away, she filled us in on many details, and was available for questions. 

The apartment is charming, and we fixed a number of meals there, and found all the pots and pans we needed. It is a very atmospheric place, and even though lighting was a bit low in the living room, we did manage. The view out the windows is of a little piazza, and it was fun to stand on the balcony and see the activities below. It's a city, full of life, and in that way, not completely quiet, but given the location of the palazzo, it is not disruptively noisy either. We found it just right. 

Thanks Antonio for putting your charming place on Airbnb. A nice experience. 

"
49508,9063,2017-01-28T10:55:43Z,Good place in a beautiful and unusual historic city. 
49508,1422344,2017-01-21T09:06:17Z,"Antonio's apartment is located in the Kalsa district, very comfortable to walk anywhere around Palermo. We enjoyed the nereby artisan shops and the ancient focacceria. The apartment is welcoming and a great space to rest your legs after discovering the best streets of Palermo."
49508,74658308,2017-01-09T08:29:56Z,"Extraordinario. Hicimos del apartamento de Antonio nuestra casa durante los ocho días que pasamos en Sicilia.
El lugar perfecto para descubrir Palermo a pie.
En enero de 2016 con vistas a las montañas nevadas incluidas."
49508,35760458,2016-12-31T07:34:57Z,"Antonio a facilité notre arrivée en organisant notre transfert à l'aéroport par un chauffeur de taxi sérieux et sympathique et au Palazzo Catolica, il nous a accueilli avec chaleur et beaucoup de gentillesse. Il parle un français excellent et, très disponible, a tout fait pour rendre agréable notre séjour à Palerme et chez lui. "

49508,62744154,2016-12-20T00:18:56Z,"If you are musing about the appealing and pitoresque pictures with which Antonio inscenes his apartment -- marveling if the place comes close to what you extrapolate from what you have seen, be asured it completely is. Antonio offers a marvelous space right in the historic center of Palermo. Piazza Pretoria, Via Roma, Via Maqueda, the Cathedral of Palermo, everything is just a few minutes away. 
Once being there and longing for a nice osteria, a common trattoria or a fancy restaurante Antonio always has the proper recommendation. 
We had a lovely stay in Palermo and enjoyed every minute in Palazzo Cattolica; it was a pleasure chatting with Antonio now and then in the entrance hall or in the streets when bumping into him. He made our stay to feel a bit like coming home."
49508,12070657,2016-12-10T07:53:14Z,"Bell'appartamento in Bellissimo palazzo, posizione centrale sia per monumenti e chiese Che per ristoranti e locali.
Antonio risponde tempestivamente a ogni richiesta. Consigliato.
Nota bene: piano alto senza ascensore! "
49508,2153910,2016-12-03T07:09:38Z,"Чудесное место для того, чтобы остановится в Палермо. Антонио дал нам отличные рекомендации, которые действительно пригодились. Интереснейший дизайн, хорошее месторасположение и лучшая кровать за все мое путешествие по Сицилии:)"
49508,10262976,2016-11-27T09:58:12Z,"Great location, comfortable apartment.  Super clean and well stocked kitchen.  Eclectic and very interesting decor.  Don't bring a car.  Parking is difficult and the streets are really small!  Many historic sites in walking distance"
861986,118889681,2017-05-10T16:51:16Z,"She is a great host. First airbnb experience worth it. I wont write much, because i want you to find out for yourselves. I gurantee you wont want to leave.  "
861986,53446563,2017-05-07T15:12:45Z,This place is amazing and now forever special to me and my new fiancée! She said yes! Thanks for providing a great weekend Karen! 
861986,123815866,2017-05-05T22:56:21Z,"Hospitality was obvious, although we rarely saw anyone, but was directed with prompt email responses.
Big space, delightful and peaceful. Very safe environment. Beautiful huge shower, fully equipped kitchen, stereo and Direct TV. The garden surrounding the residence was filled with numerous exotic plants and the entrance creates a magic that gives your stay peaceful memories of a choice well made. Thanks for the magic for our 33rd wedding anniversary. Your place is a tremendous value, worth every penny. Londa & Loren (Texas)"
861986,119045037,2017-05-03T17:38:48Z,"When I marked ""central"" from the location choices, it's because it was central to where we wanted to be. Near beach, near freeway, close to both Santa Cruz and Monterey, but also a beautiful hillside area, secluded by the huge, beautiful garden, with enough opening for a view of the ocean. The living space was huge and open, wonderful bed, well-stocked kitchen, huge bathroom with lots of storage space. Karen was very friendly and helpful, while also giving us full privacy. Lovely place to stay!"
861986,72404574,2017-04-30T20:31:52Z,"Karen is a great host. The wine, chocolates, and breakfast items were all a great touch. We really enjoyed the outdoor space in the evening, especially using the chiminea. Would definitely visit again and recommend to others. "
861986,14564567,2017-04-29T15:14:37Z,"We enjoyed a great two-night stay at Karen's home. The space was exactly as described. Clean. Quiet. Beautiful. Comfortable. We did a morning run along the beach to Capitolla and back, and took advantage of the Monterey Bay Aquarium passes (amazing!). The home is in a beautiful and quiet residential neighbourhood, as such, there is a lot of sensitivity around noise as sound travels easily. The garden patio is beautiful but you will be encouraged to keep any late night conversations (after 9 pm) indoors rather than outdoors. This wasn't a problem for us as we were exhausted from all of our daytime adventures by this time each night. Would definitely stay here again."
861986,111434971,2017-04-27T20:48:15Z,Karen's home is very beautiful and peaceful. From the third floor you have a clear view of the ocean and it's amazing. Karen was just a great host and definitely recommend her home to others 
861986,72793425,2017-04-24T17:05:47Z,"Karen's home and hospitality are unmatched. Beautiful, peaceful, relaxing, and decorated to perfection. Karen's personal touches are the icing on the cake and I can't thank her enough for allowing us to stay. "
861986,86723145,2017-04-21T23:20:12Z,"Die Wohnung ist absolut hochwertig und sehr geschmackvoll dekoriert. Sie liegt im Erdgeschoss im schönen Garten. Ich habe die Terrasse oben bei der Besitzerin nicht genutzt, da ich zu spät abends zurück kam. 
Für mich alleine war die Wohnung zu groß, daher auch zu teuer. Sie liegt in einem reinen Wohngebiet, ein Auto ist unerlässlich für Einkaufen, Strand, Restaurant, Santa Cruz. 
Mir persönlich waren es zu viele Instruktionen, aber es ist alles völlig unkompliziert. "
861986,3790850,2017-04-17T21:21:08Z,"Beautiful space with an attentive host. As other guests have mentioned, Karen is very responsive and accommodating. Place is very clean, great kitchen to cook in, open layout with lots of TV streaming options if you want to stay in.

There's a separate entrance and the only connection to the rest of the house is through outside staircase (that leads to open terrace on 3rd floor), so it felt very private. It was unfortunate (but still beautiful) that it was raining during our trip. We would definitely book again to enjoy the garden and terrace during the summer."
861986,120098799,2017-04-16T17:10:16Z,"Karen is fantastic. The apartment is spotless and the garden is beautiful. It's the perfect place for a relaxing weekend away from city noise. 
Karen helped me so much for this particular trip. She tipped me off to some restaurants and bars in the area and she even went so far as to pick up a cake for me from a nearby bakery so it would be there when we arrived. 
She is very clear about house rules and leaves detailed instructions on how everything works (ie tv, netflix, lights, etc.). Such a cozy and beautiful spot, I would absolutely recommend the location and the host. "
861986,7721667,2017-04-07T17:14:52Z,"Karen's hospitality was great. Bagel, yogurt, tea, granola. All the little fixings to make an overnight well worth it and extra special. Thanks! "
861986,60167017,2017-04-03T18:44:00Z,"very very quiet and private despite the residential setting. easy to access and with an understanding that 'the little things are the big things', this Karen and place excelled"
861986,119511246,2017-03-30T18:36:58Z,"Karen's place is unbelievably beautiful, quiet, & peaceful!! My husband & I were just here to celebrate our anniversary...what a perfect place for that! Lots of snacks & breakfast items, Keurig machine....& nothing better then a bottle of wine waiting for you! Close to tons of beaches, restaurants, & shops. This was our 1st Airbnb stay...& our only fear is it ruined us for future visits elsewhere!!  THANKS KAREN, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL HOST!!!"
861986,135347,2017-03-26T18:59:35Z,"Such a great place! Very true to the photos. Everything is well stocked, with so many details thought of. It was the perfect place for a quiet weekend retreat. Check in/out was easy, and Karen was a great host, and easy to get a hold of. I would stay again, and recommend to anyone looking for a calming, relaxing place. "
861986,15013643,2017-03-22T15:08:50Z,"Karen's place was wonderful. I felt as if I were in an oasis, peaceful and in my own world. She was helpful in every way. When I said I usually only had fruit and cheese for breakfast, Karen had mandarins, an apple and a wedge of Gouda for me. As you review the photos showing her place, you need to realize they do not do her home justice. Truly an amazing place. There were even fresh flowers and chocolate truffles waiting for me. I highly recommend her place and if I am in the area again, I would definitely try to stay there again. "
861986,18353028,2017-03-19T18:12:21Z,"Our stay at the Garden Sanctuary was inspiring, comfortable and very cozy. We spent a lot of time in the garden watching and enjoyed the amenities inside. We were greeted with some wine and treats when we arrived. Loved our stay!"

 Karen was lovely and took good care of us. Also really happy to use the Monterey Bay aquarium passes. Thanks."
861986,104292212,2017-03-14T16:47:25Z,"Karen was an amazing host. Her place was Amazing. The view was amazing, everything was amazing. The beach was so close and it was a relatively quiet neighborhood. Make sure to give Karen the credit she deserves because her home she has created for you is just so prefect. "
861986,15459721,2017-03-09T18:16:50Z,"Karen was very sympathic host and provide us all we need. A bootle and some food at ou arrival, kind attention. The view is stunning (2nd floor, you will live at the 1st). Netflix/Pandora/Monterey Bay Aquarium passes are really a plus for the visit. The appartement/bathroom was very clean but the recent storm brings some ants around"
388137,102856946,2017-05-05T06:34:24Z,"Estuvimos con mi esposa 3 dias para fines de abril y primeros días de mayo del 2017. El apartamento es hermoso, cómodo, limpio, muy bien cuidado y con una vista increible. Panos, muy buen anfitrión. Personalmente le agregaria, algo que para nosotros fue muy importante, por nuestra edad. No lo recomiendo para personas mayores o con algun problema fisico, ya que el acceso es muy dificultoso, estrecho y muy pero muy empinado.  Esto hace que una vez que estas allí, salir sea prácticamente imposible, por lo extenuante de cada subida y bajada. El acceso al supermarket mas cercano, son entre 400 o 500 metros de los cuales mas de la mitad por lo menos son en subida. "
388137,114603445,2017-05-01T08:11:57Z,"Spitia Luxury Caves was absolutely amazing! It is pretty far down the cliff so a lot of stairs (like everywhere in Oìa). This made it feel like we were right in the middle of the action, but in a private setting. There is no patios above you, and the ones below you are hidden so you have the absolute best private show of the sunset!! The hot tub is amazing and so was the cave house. Panos had great communication, gave great restaurant recommendations and even arranged a sailing trip from Ammoudi Bay for us. The villa overlooks Ammoudi Bay as well and has a great view of the old Oìa castle! Many great restaurants and tavernas within walking distance. Our stay at Spitia Luxury Cave was the perfect end to our honeymoon in Greece!"
388137,111007289,2017-04-22T06:49:27Z,Great location with a perfect view of the sunset. The apartment was more than we could have asked for!
388137,10096310,2017-04-02T08:55:30Z,"An amazing place to live out your dream vacation in Oia. This is my second time here, and forgetting the paint smell that was a bit of an downer the first few nights, I'm looking forward to coming back again if it works out. When I remember my vacation from Greece, this place is where my memories drift back to. It is simple but pure bliss and beauty. I hope to visit again soon. Also, the woman who cleans is very nice and does great work cleaning everything. This place is a dream come true. "
388137,79975080,2017-03-25T08:18:09Z,Thank you:)
388137,16172427,2016-10-30T09:41:59Z,"Panos was very responsive and helpful even before our stay.  He provided us with information for the surrounding areas as well as arranged transfers for us and a porter to carry our bags.  

Panos villa was absolutely perfect and in the IDEAL santorini location.  We were on the cliff's ledge with little to no obstructions of our view of the sea.  There was a DELICIOUS restaurant a few flights of stairs above us.  I could not imagine having a more perfect stay.  "
388137,2066503,2016-10-27T08:56:01Z,"This is by far the best experience we've ever had. We usually stay in ""safe"" hotels around the world but this time I wanted to venture out into the neighborhood to get a sense of the local scene. It's the first time we use Airbnb and I'm glad we did. Panos is very communicative and followed through on everything he promised. The cave house was cute and comfortable. The view of the sunset is unbeatable. A word of caution: If you have issues climbing steps this may not be for you. Panos provided us with a porter to help with luggage otherwise it would have been impossible to both find the cave house and lug our luggage to it. After a couple days, we got used to climbing the stairs and lost a little weight in the process! I highly recommend this place to those seeking an adventure and jaw-dropping views."
388137,56086189,2016-10-24T01:02:29Z,"My wife and I stayed in Panos' Sunset Cave House in Oia for our honeymoon and we could not have picked a more perfect place to stay! The location and views are amazing! The location provides sunset views that almost nowhere else in Santorini can provide. The Cave House is very clean and perfect for two people. The first floor includes a living and dining area with a small but fully equipped kitchen and full bathroom and the upstairs is a bedroom loft. Breakfast (fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, juice, coffee etc...) was provided each morning between 900-930 and a maid service was provided each day around 11AM.

We never met Panos in person but he was easily accessible to answer any questions we had. We arranged our transportation to and from the airport through Panos which I would highly recommend as it comes with a porter to help you get your luggage to and from the Cave House which you will definitely need. There are a lot of steps up and down to get to the Cave House and the porter definitely helps! We are young so the number of steps were not an issue and transcending them each day was worth it given the amazing views the location provided. The Cave House is a 5 minute or so walk to amazing restaurants, shops and the center of Oia.

Everything in the Cave Houses description is as described. The house is very clean and all amenities were provided that are listed.

I would highly recommend Panos' Cave House vs staying in any of the boutique hotels in Oia. The value and location can not be beat. "
388137,16998012,2016-10-16T08:52:04Z,"This place is AMAZING!!  I came here with two other friends for my birthday celebration!  Once you're here, you really do have a front row view of the famous Santorini sunsets and just the beauty of Oia.  I will let you know in advance, it's a bit of a hike with a lot of steps...but it's 100% worth it!  Panos was wonderful in helping me get prepared for the Santorini portion of my Greece trip!  He was very responsive to my messages and also gave me heads up notices when there was going to be a strike at the Athens airport, but luckily I was taking a ferry to the other locations, but it was still nice to know that he was looking out for us.  He also coordinated to a transfer from the Port when we arrived and when we left for the airport (30 Euros/trip) and also for a porter to help us with our luggage when we arrived and left.  Trust me.  You WILL need the porter (remember...lots of steps!!).  The place itself is beautiful and clean and we had breakfast prepared every morning.  This location is on one end of Oia, but is close walking distance to the center area.  I really enjoyed this location though because it was nice and quiet in the evenings and you could really just relax and take in the beauty.  I highly recommend this place and would 100% stay here when I come back to Santorini.  Because I'm definitely going to come back!  Thanks, Panos!"
388137,26093537,2016-10-13T01:53:11Z,"Panos' place was absolutely perfect for us, a couple on our honeymoon. The place has everything you would need, even for a long stay, and is actually surprisingly private and quiet given most places in the area are surrounded by lots of other decks and walk ways and people. The two deck areas are ideally placed for the sunset and the jacuzzi is great too.
Really comfy bed, and nice bathroom with nice big shower.
We thought this place was great value given you get a nice breakfast every morning and house keeping daily, but much nicer and more private than any hotel could have been.
Thanks and we'll be back we hope!"
388137,56621073,2016-10-08T11:04:55Z,Our stay at Sunset Caves was AMAZING! The view is spectacular and very private. Our porter Tim was helpful with directions and very friendly. Our breakfast in the morning was delicious and right on time. The place was incredibly clean and so comfortable. We would highly recommend staying here and plan in being back! Working with Panos was a breeze. 
388137,50578707,2016-10-05T01:15:24Z,What a wonderful place in a perfect location. The place really is as beautiful as the pictures. The host was great at getting us settled in and we really enjoyed our stay. The views are absolutely breathtaking. I highly recommend staying here. 
388137,84193967,2016-10-01T11:14:46Z,Beautifully presented cave house in a spectacular position. From the spa and table you have one of the best views of the sunset. We did not meet Panos but he was responsive by message and the staff were helpful
388137,43323898,2016-09-28T06:49:07Z,Nice sunset
388137,31325966,2016-09-27T05:22:41Z,"Panos was a fantastic host. He took care of every request. His response was fast. Our stay was amazing. The location is the best in town, being more secluded that other parts. The view is beautiful. The staff are very friendly. Breakfast was served every morning on the balcony. "
388137,237854,2016-09-24T03:21:33Z,"The location is perfect. Absolutely wonderful view of the sunset. Panos made sure we had everything we needed, including taxi transfers which was a huge help. The place was very clean and beautifully decorated. Highly recommend!"
388137,59605280,2016-09-22T10:19:09Z,Panos was very welcoming! He carried our bags from our port pickup and brought us straight to our room. He showed us around and explained how things work. Gave great recommendations of places to go in the area. The view was absolutely breathtaking! Would DEFINITELY recommend! 
388137,9941566,2016-09-21T03:02:28Z,Most unbelievable sunset view! The cave house is the perfect relaxing romantic spot.
388137,91131267,2016-09-17T07:58:29Z,"Panos was an exceptional host. Even taking time out of his schedule to come and visit and make sure everything was perfect which it was! Everything about the place exceeded all expectations. What a place and what a view. The maid who comes for breakfast and takes care of every need was also a hero! Everything to the last detail could not have been better. 

Thanks Panos! "
388137,44777397,2016-09-17T02:46:01Z,My husband and I had the most wonderful timing at this cave house for our honeymoon. The sunset view (and people watching when the crowds gather high above you) are fabulous! It was very clean with nice amenities in the bathroom and kitchen. The cleaning services and provided breakfast made this an even better experience. The plunge pool was so nice to have for an afternoon/evening dip. Excellent location in Oia. Transfers arranged by Panos went very smoothly. Can't wait to come back!
1114991,33779117,2017-05-12T20:18:03Z,"Perry was a wonderful host. Very communicative and gave us privacy for the one night trip. The house is beautiful, and it's perfectly serene for a retreat getaway.  "
1114991,100949838,2017-05-07T22:07:46Z,This place is amazing!!! Such a unique and magical stay with my husband for our 2 years anniversary. 
1114991,5361821,2017-04-28T15:24:02Z,My husband and I loved our stay at The Tile House. It was so much fun looking at all the different tiles and knick knacks on the walls and around the house. We were finding new things to be excited about everyday. We also loved the picture windows in the living room. I fell in love with the desert sunset! Perry was a great host and responded to questions and concerns very quickly. We would love to stay here again if we ever make it back out that way.
1114991,26336686,2017-04-20T20:52:33Z,Totally enchanting--there wasn't one square inch of this house that didn't make us happy.
1114991,5883537,2017-04-16T15:53:06Z,This is by far the most special place I've had the pleasure of staying at.  A true sanctuary.  
1114991,633974,2017-04-14T15:16:37Z,"The most unique and memorable Airbnb I've ever been to. Not only was it like staying inside a museum, it was also comfy, warm, inviting, and clean. Don't miss this. "
1114991,886525,2017-04-13T15:38:56Z,"Fantastic! Unique! Artsy! It took us about a whole day to look at every single detail. We truly had an unforgettable stay. We did a liquid diet cleanse and so we cooked yummy soups, smoothies, juices and shots in the wonderful kitchen. The dogs were beyond thrilled. Can't wait to go back!"
1114991,2733063,2017-03-26T08:13:57Z,"Fabulous, as always. Don't hesitate to book this one, it's truly one of a kind. Can't wait to get back and see what Perry will do next to the place. "

1114991,17501118,2017-02-26T17:56:05Z,The Tile House is centrally located by Twenty-Nine Palms and Joshua Tree. It's a Beautiful house with a great view of the stars. The creative atmosphere makes you feel rejuvenated. 
1114991,111801122,2017-02-24T18:41:18Z,"Fun, quirky, comfortable, and so much fun to stay in the Tile House!  Perry is a wonderful host and communication was fast and easy. I highly recommend spending some time here. And exploring the area!  Joshua Tree NP and The Integratron sound bath are two things you should check out in the area!!"
1114991,111582350,2017-02-20T17:17:56Z,"Incredible home - Had the best weekend... No complaints whatsoever, can't wait to go back!! <3"
1114991,71553548,2017-02-18T18:45:42Z,"What a quirky and whimsical spot in the desert, about 15 minutes from Joshua tree NP. Nice layout with several outdoor spaces, a large dining table, 2 queen sized beds, and a yoga/meditation room. Plenty of soaps and cooking staples in case you forget something. Keep in mind this place is pretty far out. You want to arrive with everything you need!"
1114991,88682629,2017-02-15T18:28:27Z,PURE MAGIC.
1114991,4058009,2017-02-14T19:26:58Z,"My fiance and I had a great time staying at Perry's place, it's a real work of art. Joshua Tree National Park is close by, I recommend doing some hiking and coming back to enjoy the hot tub and stargazing, a truly relaxing experience."
1114991,18817038,2017-02-12T19:12:28Z,"Tile House was truly magical!  The property was the perfect place to enjoy the desert sunset.  We stargazed from the hot tub and made s'mores over the fire pit.  The house was clean, comfortable and a feast for the eyes.  Perry was easy to communicate with and was extremely accommodating.  We would definitely return for a longer stay!"
1114991,80112899,2017-02-08T16:12:38Z,The Tile House was an awesome experience. The house is so much fun and very unique. The house is a happy house! We had a great time. Thanks Perry

1234474,44649992,2017-05-10T04:08:53Z,"Consider yourself very lucky if you manage to book this place. Don't think twice!!! We cannot recommend high enough! Staying in Hila & Dai's place was the best experience of our trip! They are exceptional hosts full with love & care. The house is just AMAZING, and the village is so quiet & authentic that it's nothing short but a great pleasure to feel a part of it even for such a short period. We are grateful for the superb experience and the good times we spent in Tamatori and wish we could have just live there and help Dai chop bamboos forever. 

Seriously, cut all the tourist mambo jambo and go to chill between the bamboo forests and the green tea fields with the coolest hosts around."
1234474,2444716,2017-05-04T02:54:33Z,"Wow, what great hosts and pleasurable trip. I can't recommend enough if you're looking for a unique and relaxing experience. And their cooking is fantastic "
1234474,44544682,2017-05-02T00:45:16Z,Amazing house and amazing hosts. The area is great for hiking and relaxing. Can't recommend enough! Will definitely come back next time we're in Japan. Thanks Dai and Hila!
1234474,5651652,2017-04-30T01:53:57Z,"This place is an absolute gem. As travellers looking for a place to relax and discover Japan's beautiful countryside, we felt that we struck gold. Everything was exactly as described - no, as a matter of fact, everything exceeded our expectations. Hila & Dai are wonderful hosts who communicate promptly and will do the utmost to accommodate your every need. Thank you so much! "
1234474,30578862,2017-04-26T23:39:46Z,"The Japanese house of our dreams! We cannot recommend the house and the hosts enough. Dai and Hila were amazing and we loved staying with them. The valley is breathtaking, the house is squeaky clean and whole vibe is enough to make you want to let go of your daily jobs and move to the Japanese countryside. PS - Highly recommend the breakfast which is incredibly fresh! "
1234474,114297783,2017-04-26T00:45:29Z,"Consider yourself truly lucky if you have a chance to experience this authentic traditional Japanese home. Dai and Hila are very warm and welcoming and will give you all the assistance you need for quiet walks in the beautiful hills surrounding their home, while still respecting your need for privacy. We hope there is a chance for us to meet again!
Warm regards 
Liz and Deirdre x"
1234474,6489726,2017-04-22T01:42:22Z,"We had such a great time at Dai and Hila's place. The house is amazing and such a lovely place to spend a few relaxing days. We were able to do some trekking which was beautiful and takes you past tea plantations, bamboo forests and waterfalls.  We were also able to do a bamboo workshop with Dai and visit his bamboo farm and harvest some shoots, which was lucky for us as it is a short season. Hila is a fantastic chef and cooked us lovely dinners and breakfasts. Nothing was too much trouble for either of them, and they made our stay really memorable. Will be recommending to friends visit g Japan."
1234474,22146987,2017-04-17T23:57:43Z,"I had an amazing time at Daisuke and Hila's gorgeous home. The setting is exquisite, the home was absolutely stunning, and Daisuke and Hila were wonderful, considerate, and kind hosts. 
From the handwritten guidebook notes, complete with photographs to find your way on walks, to their assistance with any questions, Hila and Daisuke were very friendly and extremely helpful. I can warmly recommend their home. "
1234474,57919810,2017-04-15T02:33:17Z,"Dai and Hila are both exceptionally wonderful hosts who provided us with a sincere heartfelt welcome and are both genuine people who gave us a unique and beyond local experience through each interaction we had be it amazing breakfast and dinner, spectacular bamboo harvesting, tea ceremony and local insights on the community. We felt so welcome and well treated it leaves our prior stay at St. Regis Osaka far behind as despite the five stars it is not as authentic and genuine as we experienced here. We are so glad to have had the privilige and honor to be their guests. Best stay ever."
1234474,11634852,2017-04-13T01:54:38Z,"Séjour exceptionnel chez Hila and Dai, des personnes d'une extrême gentilesse et d'un accueil hors pair.  Tout était parfait dans ce séjour où on a été accueillis comme des rois! La maison est magnifique et chaleureuse, l'environnement à la campagne est de toute beauté.  Nous avons eu l'occasion de participer à une cérémonie de thé et avons fait la marche dans Tamitori, la forêt de bambou.  C'était exceptionnel!  Ne manquez pas de prendre au moins un repas préparé par Hila et Dai, c'est excellent.  La meilleure soupe aux mille parfums  jamais dégustée!  Nous sommes restés 2 jours, nous y serions restés 3 pour faire du vélo dans la campagne environnante.  Nous vous recommandons chaudement ces hôtes, qui sont à notre avis les meilleurs qu'Airbnb puisse avoir.  Ne rater pas cette occasion exceptionnelle!"
1234474,42596064,2017-04-10T00:49:17Z,"Si vous aimez l'agitation, le bruit, restez dans le centre de Tokyo ou dans la gare de Kyoto! Par contre si vous allez au Japon avec le désir d’appréhender cette culture, alors arrêtez vous chez Hila et Dai. Vous trouverez une maison, vieille de 100 ans, bois, tatamis et cloisons de papier, entièrement rénovée pour y vivre à la japonaise. Table basse chauffante pour le dîner, salle de bain avec tub et eau pure de la rivière, salon confortable, cuisine bien équipée et des chambre où vous vous endormirez en écoutant la rivière en contre-bas. Les propriétaires, jeunes, dynamiques, adorables, disponibles vous régaleront si vous leur demander de cuisiner pour vous et vous conseilleront pour des ballades dans leur bambouseraie ou au milieu des champs de thé vert. Le temps s'est comme arrêté! Trois jours inoubliables, merci encore"
1234474,27334679,2017-04-06T01:22:26Z,"Hila and Dai's place is a true gem--as are they! If they have any availability, book immediately! It will be the highlight of your trip to Japan. Easy access from the shinkansen (and they are so kind to come and pick up from the train station.) The house is even more beautiful than the pictures and the area completely serene and relaxing. We were there during bamboo harvesting season and were even able to go into the forest for a tour and dig up our own shoot (which they cooked for us and was so delicious). Hila and Dai have perfected Japanese hospitality and it was a joy to be in their home and part of their lives for a few days."
1234474,5095340,2017-04-04T02:23:50Z,"We have nothing but glowing things to say about Dai and Hila and their absolutely lovely and magical home in Yui Valley. 

This was our first visit to Japan and while we wanted to experience the big cities of Kyoto and Tokyo we knew we wanted to experience another side of Japan, one that would allow us to see smaller towns and enjoy being outdoors. We stumbled across Yui Valley which was perfectly situated between our two city destinations and instantly knew when we booked that it would be special. 

First things first, Hila and Dai are the loveliest people. We opted for dinner and breakfast and would highly recommend you do the same - the meals are so tasty, in fact I think they should be offering cooking classes too, that's how delightful they were! :) 

We also opted to join in for a morning at their Bamboo farm, lucky for us it was shoot harvesting season and we had the opportunity to dig up our own shoots which Hila cooked for us later that evening. For anyone who has plans to visit the Bamboo forest in Kyoto, this experience beats it x10! No tourists, an amazing ride up to the forest and it's incredibly peaceful. Don't miss out!

Per Hila and Dai's recommendations we went for a hike to attempt to catch a sight of the elusive Mt. Fuji.  The hike was stunning, and while we didn't see the mountain, we very much enjoyed the hike with its sweeping views of the valley and wild Sakura which were beginning to bloom. From there we walked down to eat Soba noodles for lunch and opted for a walk back to the house. Warning, it's a very long walk, but well worth it if you have the time! 

Now, the house. It's INCREDIBLE! Hila and Dai have worked so very hard to bring back the integrity of this stunning traditional home and the love they've put into it shows.

Overall, in case you can't tell, we simply fell in love with our time in Yui Valley so much that we didn't want to continue our trip to Tokyo. If you're debating on staying two days, book three. 

Thank you again for everything, Dai and Hila - we'll be back soon! 



"
1234474,82775336,2016-11-06T01:48:31Z,"Dai-chan and Hila-chan are the best (not an overstatement) Airbnb host we encountered so far in Japan (we stayed at 3 different places). They were attentive to us before, during and after our stay at their beautiful place. This gets a perfect 10/10 from us - because they really deserve it. Hospitality was top notch, accommodation was fantastic (from the cleanliness to the decor) and the food was just heavenly. All guest absolutely MUST try their dinner and breakfast. It was also such an engaging experience to learn about their life and work as well. Hila-chan is so caring and careful, equivalent to a Ryokan's Okami-san. Dai-chan is such a multi-talented and friendly host as well.
Do ask for their ""bags of happiness"" for dinner. It tastes sublime!
Overall a fantastic, wonderful experience at Dai and Hila's. Totally recommend it to all, and will definitely be coming back!"
1234474,6540612,2016-11-03T00:41:41Z,"We LOVED every minute of our stay. It was like staying at a ryokan but more relaxing. We were there in early November, and it was getting cold. That was never a problem. The kotatsu and the numerous space heaters kept us warm, the bed was super comfy, the ofuro (Japanese bath) was a treat, the food was fantastic, and our day trips (which Hila san either took us on or helped us with) were fun and interesting. Hila san and Daisuke san have done a great job making the house as comfortable and attractive as could be while still retaining the home' s traditional features. They looked after our every need. We would love to come back again. Highly recommended. "
1234474,11578255,2016-10-29T00:53:23Z,"One of our best Airbnb experiences ever. For us, this was the perfect stopover between a week in Tokyo and a week in Kyoto. We loved walking and cycling in the Japanese countryside for four days. It is a feast to be there. The beautiful mountains and villages, the friendly people, it's all very lovely and relaxing. The house is beautiful and very comfortable. Hila and Dai are the best hosts you could wish for. They are easy going and have a great sense of humor. They are great cooks too! You'll want to take pictures of all the plates en bowls. On top of that they give you all the help you might need – in our case, they got us some medicine we didn't know where or how to ask for, plus Hila raced us to a bus we were almost late for. It's the little things that make you feel at home. Ja toch?!"
1234474,11788224,2016-10-22T01:52:48Z,Dai and Hila's place was absolutely perfect. More beautiful than we were expecting! Both Dai and Hila were amazing hosts and made us feel so comfortable and relaxed. This was such an incredible experience and we would recommend to anyone! 
1234474,94398207,2016-10-18T01:46:01Z,"Hila and Dai were really lovely hosts! Their ryokan is cozy and comfortable, and it's very clear a lot of thought went into each detail of its design. We spent two nights there and during the day we didn't even leave - we just relaxed and read our books to the sounds of nature. Their home is nestled between green tea fields, a bamboo forest, and a gushing river.  Both the dinner and breakfast they made for us were fresh and delicious, made with local ingredients - some made by their neighbors, like the honey, cheese, and tea. We came with so many questions after 2 weeks in the Japanese countryside, and Hila happily answered all of them. We would definitely come back!!"
1234474,49309985,2016-10-15T01:35:09Z,Had the most amazing time at Dai and Hila's place. They have such a beautiful home in such a pristine location. If I am ever in Japan again I will 100% return. They are also both such kind and gentle people. Thank you so much for everything!!
1234474,9089479,2016-10-14T02:20:24Z,"Hila and Dai are awesome hosts! We felt so welcomed and the stay was an amazing experience. We got picked up from the train station and Hila and Dai explained a lot about the surrounding and their live.
The house is beautiful where you feel like at home.
We ordered some dinner and it was one of the best we ever had: absolutely delicious and a huge variety was served(a special thank you for the veggi option). Afterwards we were so full but very happy.
Hila and Dai recommended a hike tour: great landscape!

Last but not least we got a little present of Dai's mum: little sweet potato pralines. Yummy!

All in all: an incredible stay!"
4222643,57710917,2017-05-13T23:06:15Z,"Great location. Very quiet and typical neighbourhood. The apartment is awesome, we love the architecture and the atmosphere. mitsu and akane are great hosts. We had an amazing time with them when dinner at their house. Cook was great. 
I highly recommand this location "
4222643,22808075,2017-05-04T23:25:58Z,"staying in Akanene's home is a great experience :-))))
The house is perfect to feel the jamanese way of life. 
It s also very quiet by night !
Akanene and Mitsu (and their baby ) are very nice and welcoming.
The house is closed to the metro and perfect to discover Tokyo !!!"
4222643,109383212,2017-04-20T01:03:46Z,"Akane and Mitsu's place is a spacious, traditional style Japanese home. I loved all the details around the house, including the chalkboard with Japanese characters/common words and the artwork. They are very kind and sweet hosts. Akane was also very helpful and great at communicating with us. "
4222643,43132006,2017-04-18T00:57:41Z,"Wonderful traditional duplex house with a cute garden. Living room, bathroom and kitchen downstairs, tatami style bedroom upstairs and comfy beddings.

We loved the space, the art, the little garden, the rooms... We are truly happy we chose this house for our stay in Tokyo. Don't hesitate to stay here! The subway station is a few minutes walk away, even if you come back really tired it doesn't matter when you arrive and relax in the living room. Stay here!"
4222643,8992557,2017-04-08T01:19:54Z,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay here and wouldn't have done our week in Tokyo any differently! Staying in Kotu gives you a little glimpse into what it would be like to live in a Tokyo suburb and commute into the city, and Kotu itself is very charming. The guest house has everything you need and is incredibly comfortable. Akanene is an amazing host and gave us wonderful recommendations and even offered to drive us to the local subway station during our check out because it was raining. Overall I highly recommend staying here - the location is wonderful, the home is beautiful, and it's a perfectly unique experience that will leave you feeling very inspired! "
4222643,74270149,2017-04-02T23:14:50Z,"A very nice traditional Japanese old wooden house.  I stay here for 3 days and I experienced the Japnese way of living. Highly recommended to anyone who want to explore the Japanese lives.

Courteous hosts and a beautiful traditional house with all the amenities you need. All in all a great place from which to enjoy Tokyo. Highly recommended and great value. 

P.s. the nearby 7-eleven takes most international credit cards, lifesaver! "
4222643,29075508,2017-03-19T00:49:31Z,"The place is located in a quiet residential neighborhood, where there are plenty of paths along the river to take a good walk in the weekends. The house is a simple but nicely decorated Japanese style home. It is extremely quiet and also very comfortable to sit at the living room facing the garden in the backyard. Everything is easy to use. Akane and Mitsu were a wonderful host, who is very friendly and can accommodate guests' requests. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic residential life in Tokyo area."
4222643,40332427,2017-03-17T02:47:38Z,"Highly recommend!

We really enjoyed the atmosphere!
4222643,11422322,2017-02-19T23:30:22Z,Fabulous traditional Japanese building. Our hosts were amazing. We were very happy at old Folk House and we would be delighted to recommend it to other travellers.
4222643,104860275,2017-02-18T00:41:11Z,"房子比照片更有感覺
一開始不知道有兩層還蠻驚訝的
家裡什麼都有 超級齊全
還有借我們pocket wifi!!
最讚的是 水温!
洗澡的時候好舒服
完全沒有斷水 或是溫不穩定的問題!
雖然走路去地鐵站還是要大概15分鐘
但路也是很容易記的 
第一天來到也差不多11點 
房東怕我們不會路會危險
還開車出來接我們
真的..
房子跟房東都超級棒!"
4222643,52286150,2017-02-13T03:18:01Z,"Akannene's old fork is very Lovely&tradition。特别适合一家人来东京,感受当地生活和休息,屋里都是房东自己的艺术设计品:陶杯、暖垫、抱枕……还有一个小院子,Akanene一家人住在对面楼里,感谢你们的周到准备和款待,下次来东京还会选择这里~~也会介绍给更多的朋友,让他们来感受Old fork的魅力!"
4222643,11171726,2017-02-10T02:28:42Z,"Great place, large size compared to everywhere else we stayed in Tokyo and indeed Japan. 

Yes, house was drafty but we expected this (winter, previous reviews).  Heating once it got going was effective, table warmer was great touch.  

Easy to find from local subway station. The walk was not long, although we tend not to travel with much luggage.  

We'd definitely stay again, albeit next time aim for another time of the year.  Thanks again.  "
65010,92513498,2017-05-11T13:22:11Z,We had an amazing time staying at the yurt for our 1st anniversary! We were constantly surrounded by beautiful scenery and the yurt was so unique and cozy. 
65010,119597594,2017-05-07T14:25:27Z,"We stayed here for a romantic getaway.  The yurt is unique and comfortable, located on a scenic farm in the heart of wine country.  We hiked old rag and enjoyed wine tastings "
65010,56387417,2017-04-25T17:42:54Z,Truly a little slice of heaven-the most peaceful time we could have imagined. Whitt & Martha have made such an incredible home in the mountains-its hard to believe all of the little touches! But that's what makes the space so perfect. Hope to be back someday on another trip South. 
65010,113126640,2017-04-24T13:16:11Z,Our night at the Yurt was great.  Martha and Whitt were extremely helpful and very easy to get in touch with.  I told Martha that I was interested in purchasing some lamb but that I wasn't an excellent cook and was wondering if it was already prepared or seasoned.  Not only did Martha look up recipes for me and send them to me ahead of time (with instructions on what was already at the Yurt and what I needed to bring myself) she also had the lamb sitting out when I arrived and everything else waiting in the fridge at the Yurt.  Overall great stay and definitely plan on returning. 
65010,104928438,2017-04-23T12:39:56Z,"Whitt and Martha's farm is a tranquil retreat - the perfect getaway for those who love nature and animals. My friends and I stayed in the yurt, which accommodated the four of us quite comfortably. Whitt greeted us on arrival with Martha's chocolate chip cookies (she's a great baker!) and banana nut muffins. Be sure to ask for a tour of the farm - Whitt and Martha take care of their goats, sheep, chickens, and ducks year-round with the help of Aslan and Hector, two friendly Great Pyrenees. Remember to order fresh produce from the farm goods menu and bring a swimsuit for the hot tub and pool. You will enjoy watching the Milky Way pass you by as the stars light up the evening sky. We can't wait to return to Cair Paravel."
65010,11051608,2017-04-21T20:56:33Z,Whitt and Martha's yurt was such a great getaway!! They were great hosts and the bread Martha made was amazing! We would definitely love to come back some time soon!
65010,120727747,2017-04-19T12:20:05Z,Loved the yurt! The weather was beautiful. Multiple hiking routes can be easily accessed on foot from the farm. Gorgeous setting. Whitt and Martha were wonderful hosts. 
65010,71700248,2017-04-17T20:39:58Z,"Thank you Whitt and Martha for the amazing yurt visit! The blooming cherry blossoms where absolutely BEAUTIFUL! The views were spectacular; especially on our early morning coffee walk on the onsite farm trial feet from the yurt! Kitchen and bathroom were both beyond well stocked with spices, pots and pans, shampoo and body wash! I can not wait to visit the yurt again! And ps: Martha's cookies are to die for! "
65010,5545027,2017-04-16T12:43:53Z,The yurt provided a perfect weekend get away.  The views and trails were a perfect escape from urban life.  The farm tour was informative and the baby goats were adorable.  Whitt and Martha were wonderful hosts.  Checking in and out was easy.  I hope to visit again!
65010,56695896,2017-04-11T13:10:05Z,"A beautiful, natural setting to get away from it all!"
65010,2342193,2017-04-09T15:22:51Z,"This is an absolutely magical place. The farm soundscape, the Blue Ridge, the fresh air - and a yurt that feels straight out of Harry Potter (I'm pretty sure itvreally is bigger inside than looks possible). If I'm lucky, I'll be back within the year!"
65010,27649550,2017-04-07T12:30:17Z,"We completely loved the yurt. Our grandsons thought it was just like camping. While we had stayed in a yurt on the Oregon coast, this one was the Taj Mahal in comparison. The kitchen was very well appointed, and the loft was the favorite part. While the weather didn't totally cooperate, it was warm and cozy inside, and listening to the wind howl was actually a plus to the trip. And, of course, the tour of the barn and farm tour was a real highlight. My wife LOVES goats and goat videos. She was able to hold a one day old goat, and never stopped talking about it the rest of the day. Then of course there is the hot tub. Two tours for the boys, and one for Nana and Papa. A great time was had by all!"
65010,16832542,2017-04-02T13:19:17Z,"Whitt and Martha's farm is the perfect getaway for anyone interested in relaxing in a beautiful mountain landscape and learning about sustainable agriculture. My friends and I stayed in the yurt, which more than comfortably accommodated the 6 of us between the main bedroom, living room futon, and the beds in the loft (1 double and 2 twins pushed together). The yurt is beautifully decorated and impressively furnished with a full kitchen, dining area, living room with gas fireplace, and large bathroom with a separate shower and soaking tub. We easily prepared multiple meals in the kitchen and greatly appreciated the dishwasher afterward. Whitt and Martha are wonderful and warm hosts. When we arrived, Whitt came over to greet us with a fresh batch of Martha's cookies! At the end of our stay, they gave us a tour of the farm and welcomed us into their home. 

Tips for future guests: Bring a bathing suit - the hot tub is great in the cool evenings under the impressive starscape. Order from the farm goods menu - I recommend the eggs (deep golden yolks!) and Martha's delicious brownies and fresh bread. Go on the farm tour - Whitt talked about their approach to farming sustainably and introduced us to the animals. Since we visited in the spring, we were luck and got to hold their baby goats! Consider visiting more than once at different times of year - as a working farm, the activities and scenery change with the seasons. "
65010,2184048,2017-03-29T13:19:09Z,"If you're looking for a getaway from city life, this is it! From the views of the Blue Ridge Mountains surrounding you, to star gazing from the hot tub, this place is fantastic. The yurt itself is beautiful, spacious and feels like a home away from home immediately! "
65010,75306173,2017-03-27T15:40:42Z,"Wonderful place to stay. You get exactly what is in the pictures and we thought that was wonderful. Surprised (in a good way) about the amount of cooking materials and spices that were available. If you eat poultry, buying the fresh chicken is a must!"
65010,33289129,2017-03-19T15:53:02Z,"We stayed here with another couple for a wonderful weekend of nature, mountains, farm, hot tub, and cooking. Thoughtful and creative hosts and a truly unique experience. You have to buy some of the farm products - so delicious!"
65010,108608671,2017-03-16T12:11:55Z,"Beautiful people, beautiful home. The reality was cooler than the photos.  Wish I could have stayed longer! "
65010,45869440,2017-03-14T13:18:41Z,The Yurt and the farm are absolutely magical! I highly recommend visiting and enjoying some of the farm fresh products as well. I already can't wait to visit again sometime. 
65010,57522003,2017-03-12T14:19:54Z,"If you are looking for a getaway from the hustle and bustle, look no further than this yurt! As my daughter said when walking up to the property ""Live, Love, Yurt"". Incredible views, close to the SNP, the HOT TUB with an incredible view - especially at night, amazing hosts, the family dogs, Martha's homemade cookies to welcome us, the delicious baked goods you can purchase, the farm tour. It was amazing. We went with our two children, ages 18 and 16, and we all loved the experience. Be warned though, you need to learn how to use the Bugzooka! Great experience! Thank you Whitt and Martha!"
65010,19346503,2017-03-09T13:32:16Z,"The Yurt is described perfectly. It is up a mountain and secluded enough. You wake up to the sounds of roosters and fall asleep to the sound of nature. There is a beautiful 2 mi walk on the property and plenty to see nearby. I especially loved driving by all of the cows each day. The kitchen has the basic necessities you'd need to cook- oil, salt & pepper, various spices, pots and pans etc. YOU MUST I repeat MUST try the brownies Martha makes. They are heavenly. They are absolutely amazing. Overall the yurt is for those who enjoy the outdoors and don't mind being away from the hustle and bustle or wifi.  We will be coming back for sure."
2433060,10335731,2017-05-03T08:47:57Z,"What a fabulous view of Table Mountain and Lions Head! I would stay here again just for this, but of course there is much more to recommend this apartment. The photos are very accurate. The living space is large and comfortable. The bed is nicely firm with quality linen. The kitchen had everything we needed to be fully self-contained. I felt very safe inside the apartment as well as walking around the area during the day. I would not have walked there at night. We used Uber rides easily and they were very cheap and quick. Mike's driver, Faizel, is highly recommended as reliable, knowledgeable and witty. We had a whole day trip to Cape Point with him, as well as airport transfers. "
2433060,19341482,2017-04-27T11:30:17Z,Stunning view!!!
2433060,117344546,2017-04-21T08:32:18Z,"We absolutely loved the view from the balcony and the jacuzzi. The location is amazing and it is a good start to explore the city. The only thing we really missed was air conditioning, we were unable to sit inside the apartment during the day because of the heat. Luckily Cape Town has so much to do that there is no need to sit inside the apartment."
2433060,91386025,2017-04-19T09:08:10Z,Perfect apartment for two. The building is very quiet and security is great. The view is fantastic! Mike was very helpful if we needed recommendations or directions. He left a list of do's and don'ts for the area too. Would definitely stay here again! 
2433060,66052804,2017-04-14T07:29:55Z,"Uma excelente cobertura com uma vista incrível da Table Mountain. Exatamente como nas fotos. Apesar de ser um pouco mais caro que outras opções, a relação custo benefício definitivamente é vantajosa."
2433060,80512648,2017-04-13T08:15:57Z,The view is priceless! The place is beautiful and has everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  
2433060,4890654,2017-04-05T09:23:46Z,"We had a fantastic stay at your place, the views were incredible and the location was perfect. 

Thank you for your recommendations of places to go and eat. Truth coffee was incredible and really lived up to it's reputation. 

Thanks again, we really miss your place already!!"
2433060,42786961,2017-03-29T09:43:50Z,Great place in a great location! Breathtaking views that let you soak Capetown in! 
2433060,47447564,2017-03-25T06:22:55Z,"Perfect apartment, perfect location! I can highly recommend it"
2433060,573754,2017-03-09T07:03:54Z,"Stunning view of table mountain, spacey and light apartment with a parking space provided , ideal basis for adventuring into Cape Town and its area.
"
2433060,21593311,2017-02-28T08:44:28Z,"The apartment is really stunning and view so amazing! Thanks to the recommandation put on the table, we went to the best coffee place just around the corner and absolutely loved it. Only issue was curtains that are not working properly and therefore sun is entering the appartement as from 6AM, a bit early during vacation :-) "
2433060,9521324,2017-02-26T03:24:24Z,The views over the whole city and the mountains from the penthouse studio are amazing. It is a comfortable and well-equipped apartment where we enjoyed staying. It was also useful to have a parking space. Sol and Mike were very quick at responding to messages and a lot of information about the area was kindly available. Thank you!
2433060,7019520,2017-02-19T06:13:18Z,Central location; short Uber or taxi to many main Cape Town attractions. Covered parking is a plus for those hiring a car. for Would stay there again.
2433060,35276840,2017-02-13T09:46:55Z,"Great location, wow views over the city, secured parking, much needed pool for a refreshing dip. We were very happy with our stay here!"
2433060,11649270,2017-01-30T09:11:14Z,Great place to stay in Capetown! 
2433060,67711820,2017-01-27T04:23:43Z,The apartment was fantastic - never stayed anywhere with such amazing views. Zoleka greeted us and was lovely and available throughout our stay. Mike and Sol were charming. We loved the location too and strongly recommend District Six museum just down the road.
2433060,50384802,2017-01-23T03:14:35Z,"This was a perfect start into our SA holidays in an absolutely magnificent apartment. The view is stunning. We really felt privileged to stay here for 7 days. All worked perfectly fine from check-in to check-out. Communication was clear and fast. Whenever we had a question Mike responded almost within minutes. As recommended by Mike we used Uber to  move around in the city, and did some great day-trips with Faizel, the driver. When we come back to Cape Town this will be certainly our No1 choice to stay, if the apartment is available. "
2433060,17906175,2017-01-16T11:24:52Z,"Appartement just as described by Sol & Mike who were very helpful with many useful hints for the city - if you are a nightcrawler, than this is THE place for a short stay in Capetown, with lots of cool bars, restaurants and other chic places close by. "
2433060,242519,2017-01-13T01:25:14Z,"We loved this apartment. Amazing views, safe building and particularly liked the hot tub on the balcony which you can use as a cold plunge pool on hot days. At night the wind can get loud and unnerving on the roof, and with no air conditioning the sun really heats up the apartment on summer days but if there's a breeze you can open the windows to cool down. The room is bright in the AM so I recommend bringing eye masks if you like to sleep in. All minor considerations considering how great the views are from the 17th floor. Sol and Mike were great hosts, very thoughtful and helpful. Their neighborhood recommendations are spot on. Just be careful walking around the area and keep your iPhone and camera out of sight. "
2433060,4506630,2017-01-03T00:27:00Z,"Broken lamp, broken table on terasse, broken cabinets in the cubbyhole, clothes from landlord were hanging in the wardrobe and lying in the cabinets of the cubbyhole, mould in the shower, broken toilet paper holder"
6153074,58623678,2017-05-09T13:45:41Z,"The best airBnB that I have stayed at. From the breakfast in the morning to the 24hour security, Greisy took care of everything. She even bought a cake for one of our birthdays!  Incredible home and incredible host. A++"
6153074,909191,2017-04-30T13:48:24Z,Great spot!
6153074,16465412,2017-04-26T13:43:58Z,We absolutely loved staying in Greisy's beautiful home. It was a dream and we would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Havana. 
6153074,76219070,2017-04-23T15:57:47Z,"Thank you so much for making our stay in Cuba just amazing. The house is gorgeous, and your staff went above and beyond to help us. I would highly recommend this house, Greisy is fantastic. "
6153074,13204759,2017-04-16T12:22:38Z,We had the best stay! Greisy was an amazing host and we couldnt have wanted for anything! thank you for making our trip to Havana so special!
6153074,15347882,2017-04-11T14:55:46Z,Greases place is exactly as the pictures show..the staff are friendly and the place is safe ..we enjoyed staying there
6153074,6541298,2017-03-20T13:03:14Z,"We had a fantastic time in this beautiful place. It is as lovely as it is in the pictures, an architectural gem, spotless, and located in a nice neighborhood. The icing on the cake is the team that looks after you, all so nice and helpful, which makes it all even better. "
6153074,10521879,2017-03-07T14:40:20Z,"We really enjoyed our stay in this home. The staff was so welcoming and attentive, we felt like royalty! Perfect location! I can't wait to come back. "
6153074,109828099,2017-02-26T15:22:32Z,Great place to stay
6153074,43637738,2017-02-23T15:07:23Z,"The house is beautiful and looks exactly like the photos.  Greisy was easy to communicate prior to the trip and her staff were super helpful with recommendations for food and sight seeing, along with getting our group cabs.  I would definitely come back to Greisy's place and would highly recommend it.  Thanks for everything!!! :)"
6153074,101763044,2017-02-20T15:45:27Z,"Thank you so much for making our stay in Cuba just amazing. The house is gorgeous, and your staff went above and beyond to help us...with everything from restaurant reservations to finding the church my husband was baptized in 60 years ago!  Thank you and we would recommend your home to anyone and everyone who wants to experience Havana. "
6153074,98553242,2017-02-16T13:54:49Z,"Three couples from Southern California arrived for our first visit to La Habana on Valentine's Day -- open-eyed and in wonderment as we drove from the airport to El Palacete del Vedado.  We arrived and were greeted by friendly staff Suzette, Monica and Jenni, who helped us get settled in, setup our next two days of sightseeing and ask us what time we wanted breakfast (delicious, by the way) prepared.  We met Gabriel (overnight watchman) when we arrived post-dinner and he arranged our transportation (6-pax van) the next morning and made Cuban coffee for one of our early-rising friends in the group.  We moved to the Melia Cohiba after two nights to meet a larger travel group we often travel with, but to a person we wished our entire five-night stay in Havana would've been at Greisy's place, which is as good as it looks.  Gracias a todos y muchos recuerdos de sus amigos en Los Angeles: David, Rita, John, Dinesh, Joseph & Whitnee"
6153074,4037871,2017-02-14T17:04:27Z,"Truly a five star experience. Greisy's casa provides everything you need while in Cuba. Breakfast, beers and soft drinks in the fridge, a 24 hour on site staff that is able to accommodate what seems like everything from travel arrangements to late night food delivery. The location is safe and central. And the casa is astonishing. Also, her recommendations leading up to arrival is much appreciated as well. Of all of my experiences with Airbnb, my stay at Greisy has been by far the best and i look forward to returning in the future. "
6153074,5706947,2017-01-24T01:00:06Z,Another excellent visit to this superb property in Vedado. Gabriel and the team are like family to us at this point! 
6153074,16806193,2017-01-16T14:07:40Z,Architectural gem in vedado near the hotel presidente and taxis for a quick ride to many locations. Well staffed and attentive with 24 hour security. We really enjoyed here. 
6153074,5279153,2017-01-14T14:41:27Z,Amazing house with a great staff. Perfect place for our first Cuba experience
6153074,31109265,2017-01-06T16:19:56Z,"Palacete del Vedado was exactly as it was described in the listing. It is a beautiful home, very clean, with EXCELLENT Staff! I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Havana and desiring the Vedado area. I would love to stay at Palacete each time I visit Havana!"
6153074,2436806,2017-01-03T00:22:14Z,"Beautiful home, incredible staff and excellent location! Spent a week for new year's with my family at Greisy's and had an outstanding experience. The home is very comfortable and well appointed. The staff is the highlight! They are always available and willing to help with any request: from booking cars, to calling restaurants to helping us organize a NYE meal at the house. And, breakfast is delicious. The place is centrally located, close to the Malecon, museums and great restaurants. Looking forward to going back to Cuba and staying at Palacete del Vedado again!"
6153074,95868137,2016-12-27T13:13:31Z,"Me and my husband along with our two  kids stayed in Greisy's house during Christmas and this is by far the best home we have ever rented and we have traveled to many countries. Greisy communicated with us from when we reserved the house with recommended places to eat, visit and general tips about visiting Cuba. 

The house is in a beautiful section of Havana called Vedado and the house is absolutely breathtaking. It is easily walkable to many places and the house is very safe. 

The housekeepers (one is Greisy's sister in law) are amazing! The breakfast was delicious and they couldn't do enough for us. They don't not speak English well but I had downloaded a translator on my phone and so we didn't have a problem but I would recommend you do the same or bring a book to translate. 

This is house is worth every penny of the nightly rental and staying here feels like your staying with family. We will for sure be back and we have told all our family and friends about what a wonderful host Greisy is!"
6153074,29212472,2016-12-23T16:12:37Z,"This is a stunning apartment in Vedado. The aesthetics (high ceilings, moldings, vintage accents) are lovely.  We were met by a full-time security guard, introduced to the staff who make breakfast, and helped to make reservations. (Note that most of the folks there each day do not speak English.) It was easy to get a taxi even though the location is residential. It's an expensive Airbnb option, but with all necessary amenities and above and beyond decor. "
457458,125377830,2017-04-27T10:04:05Z,10/10 Чувствовали себя в Москве как дома.
457458,24455117,2017-04-17T07:59:15Z,"Very nice roomy flat near metro and plenty of shopping, restaurants, Starbucks and a very nice food market. The building itself and access to the flat is not nice, but once inside it is really good. Communication with Anton was perfect. "
457458,12917565,2017-04-12T10:30:21Z,"Чисто, уютно в центре, рядом метро и магазины. кафе и рестораны. В принципе все что надо для того, что бы пару дней провести в столице. "
457458,38986226,2017-04-09T08:36:05Z,"Anton is a very caring and considerate host.  He made us feel so welcomed in this beautiful country of Russia.  It was a second honeymoon for us after seven years of marriage and a wonderful, special time. "
457458,116383039,2017-03-26T07:13:50Z,Je recommande cet appartement. Vraiment bien
457458,4484711,2017-03-23T06:45:55Z,"Спасибо, все отлично!!!
"
457458,18590920,2017-03-20T05:32:20Z,"I have to say, Anton was very kind, friendly and helpful. He helped us with local number and also offered us transport from airport Vnukovo for 3000RUB (50€). But! It was not so good deal at all! Because he told us, it will be ""though Uber only slightly cheaper"".  Uber in Moscow is very cheap and our back road with Uber in traffic-yam cost only 14€! That's make us very sad. 

Apartment has a good location, only few metro stops to downtown. There is a perfect farmers market in front of building, with many opportunities for breakfast, lunch or some little foods. 

Apartment has well-equipment kitchen, was cozy and clean. The only inconvenience was bed. It is only sofa and unfortunately it was not comfortable. Also the neighbors was extremely noisy over night. (Every night till cca. 3 o'clock am it was a ""kids playground"") we couldn't sleep. 

Apartment is good only for 2 person because of bed options.

If i will go to Moscow next time, i will probably choose another place, but it was a good value because of cheap price!

302695,22792422,2017-04-14T08:20:47Z,Paola's apartment is really lovely with stunning views of Lake Como.  
302695,53461437,2017-04-11T09:13:25Z,Great location & a lovely apartment. All is as described and seen in the photographs.
302695,51291874,2017-04-08T06:46:46Z,Another wonderful wonderful stay in Paola's beautiful home. Thank you 
302695,55633453,2017-03-26T08:16:51Z,Seh schöne Wohnung mit toller Aussicht über den See. 
302695,88035131,2017-01-21T08:54:27Z,We had a wonderful stay here we would love to come back we caught the ferries and had a hire car so had a great look around 
302695,12635824,2016-11-13T08:07:25Z,We enjoyed our stay very much! Thanks
302695,40473774,2016-10-09T01:28:08Z,"Such a beautiful romantic location, we stayed here for a few days after our wedding, was perfect for what we wanted, a nice quiet break with an absolutely stunning view.  The apartment is decorated beautifully.  We arrived late but Paola's instructions on how to get in to the apartment were fantastic.  The location is perfect for sightseeing and we are hoping to return again soon."
302695,22083045,2016-10-04T03:44:05Z,"Lovely attic apartment with stunning views of the lake. Paola and Stefano were very helpful. Just bear in mind that the patio/deck pictured is not part of the space, although there is a smaller balcony with similar views."
302695,34450196,2016-09-27T04:32:40Z,"Beautiful place with a great view. Getting in and out of the home to the main part of town is about a 15-20 minute walk, but it's nice to have a walk in the morning or after dinner. 

The one thing to be aware of is that the hot water doesn't last too long, so be quick with your showers.  

Overall, we enjoyed our stay. 

Thanks!"
302695,37690961,2016-09-18T07:48:56Z,"Hosts were helpful, apartment was lovely. Menaggio 20 mins away was very central to ferry access to the lake. The 88 steps and several steep ramps to get to the apartment were challenging, especially with luggage, but Stephano helped. The patio/deck pictured is not part of the space, which was disappointing to us - we had pictured ourselves out there!"

   The attic is exceptional and the view from balconies of Lake Como is stunning.  From the romantic dinner Paola prepared on our first night, to the wine she selected from the wine grotto, to all of the information she provided regarding local sights and activities were spot on…Paola was simply the perfect host.
We would recommend this Airbnb to anyone planning a visit to Lake Como.

302695,11235069,2016-09-11T02:12:05Z,"Fantastic stay in beautiful attic property with amazing views. Ultimate in relaxation watching shooting stars in the evening with glass of presecco on the balcony & easing into the day with coffee and pastries in the morning. It's initially Tough to get the baggage to and from attic but that's the nature of the location and it's absolutely worth it. Unless you have some injuries or difficulty walking the steps should be no problem to most people. We loved the location and the short scenic stroll to town of meneggio! It's definitely one of the nicer towns on the lake and is less chaotic and touristy than Bellagio. It's a perfect base to explore the lake. If you can treat yourself to one extravagance during your stay definitely rent a speed boat. We hopefully will return again soon&wouldn't hesitate to recommend. M&S Dublin,Ireland Sept 2016"
302695,20973913,2016-08-31T08:46:56Z,"Great place to stay. Loved the view of the lake, especially at night. "
302695,11297014,2016-08-25T10:29:57Z,"L'appartement de Paola correspond exactement aux photos, la vue sur le lac de Côme est superbe et tout au long de notre séjour, Paola et Stefano se sont révélés être d'excellents hôtes : de la réservation dans un excellent resto italien en dehors des sentiers battus, aux conseils pour la visite des lieux (tous les fascicules accompagnés des explications et bons plans de Paola nous attendaient à notre arrivée) jusqu'à même la sélection de vins par Stefano à déguster au coucher du soleil sur la terrasse!
Je reviendrai sans hésiter dans cet appartement et le recommande vivement. "
302695,26548047,2016-08-22T02:55:30Z,"An amazing host, very helpful with advice on what to do on Lake Como, where to go and what to eat. The apartment was beautiful and we would recommend staying there to anyone."
302695,80579972,2016-08-18T07:39:58Z,We had a wonderful time at Paola's place. The view of the apartment makes you switch dinner to your balcony instead of going out 
302695,17492575,2016-08-16T02:33:58Z,We had the most stunning time. It was amazing. The apartment is beautiful and gorgeously decorated. Then you open the terrace door and the view is spectacular. It is mesmerizing and every morning you pinch yourself. Our hosts Stefan and Paola are beautifully kind and generous and make you feel apart of the familia - you'll be in great hands. The walk into town is 15 mins max. Close to everything you need. Had the best stay!!!! Thank you for everything - will recommend and if I come back this way I'll pop in for a visit X 
302695,31236809,2016-08-07T03:04:56Z,"Our stay in the attic apartment was simply magical! From Paola's exceptionally welcoming greeting and fantastic guide to the local area, to the beautiful apartment itself, we honestly wouldn't change a thing and we only wish we'd stayed there for longer than 5 nights! 

Every morning we enjoyed a 5 minute walk along to the little beach near the apartment where we swam in the beautiful still waters, before returning to the apartment for coffee and breakfast on the balcony. Every evening we ate dinner and drank wine on the same balcony, enjoying the twinkling lights of the towns across the lake, or firework displays, or the most phenomenal thunderstorm on our last night! 

The apartment was incredibly well equipped and exquisitely decorated. We felt completely at home and didn't want to leave! Highly recommend that you try a bottle from the cave too, we did and it was wonderful. 

The location was superb - set away from the busier centre of Menaggio but still just a level 10-15 minute walk away. Menaggio itself is a wonderful town and we are so pleased we chose to stay there. 

Top tips - do the 15€ mid lake shuttle! It's a great way to see all the towns in the middle of the lake for a very good price. Also you MUST hire a speedboat - it's the most fun we've ever had! Kayaking was also excellent. The gelato from La Fabbrica deal Gelato is to die for - we had at least one a day! We also loved visiting Villa Balbianello - gardens absolutely stunning. 

We are already desperate to return to Lake Como and when we do, we will definitely be coming back to this wonderful property! Thank you so much for everything! "
302695,15639571,2016-07-25T01:29:57Z,"Vue fantastique !
La situation à l'ombre l'après midi et en hauteur garantit la fraîcheur en fin de journée. L'air conditionné ne nous a jamais manqué. La possibilité de se garer à proximité est un plus. Wifi de très bonne qualité.
Belle décoration de charme et moderne.
Bonnes informations sur les endroits à voir et à fréquenter.
Menaggio a une situation privilégiée pour visiter la zone centrale du lac. 
Paola est une hôte très prevenante et adorable. 
Nous espérons revenir !
"
302695,47055689,2016-07-13T01:43:53Z,"Where to start... The apartment is absolute perfection, it has the most breath-taking view, is decorated so beautifully, has a very home-y vibe and Paola was a fantastic host. Paola provided us with so much information on things to do in the area and we especially loved villa Balbianello, eating at restaurants suggested by Paola and renting a boat for a few hours and cruising the lake. An extra bonus was the bikes that were provided in order to make the few kilometres trip into town so much easier. The apartment is up a large number of steps, which was an effort but should not deter you! Ththanks so much to Paola! "
1582859,43719602,2017-04-30T15:25:36Z,Alan's cottage was very nice and clean when we arrived. He showed us everything in the cottage and gave great tips for activities in the area! We loved the lofted sleeping area and quiet neighborhood--a great place to relax and recharge. 
1582859,118182708,2017-04-28T20:31:07Z,Alan's place was a perfect cozy getaway from our busy lives. It was about 35 minutes away from Acadia national park where we spent most of our time exploring. His property had a gorgeous view of the park as well. Alan was a very welcoming and accommodating host. We will definitely be back soon! 
1582859,42135476,2017-04-23T14:58:47Z,"In a weird way, I think Alan was actually our favorite part about this place. He is truly incredible man and has done a lot of amazing things with his life. He had awesome recommendations and even coupons to help you save on cost. The loft is very true as described on the website. It has everything you need, and if you happen to need something else Alan is quick to help! Like for example I forgot lotion, and he little bottles available. It was a real life saver since it was unusually cold. Elllsworth and Bar Harbor were a very quick drive from this location. Acadia was very easy to get too with signs leaving Ellsworth. He made the suggestion to go to Cadillac mountain which originally wasn't on our list to see in the park. So, we got there and it's truly the most breath taking view. We ended up spending all our time there. We definitely hope to return. "
1582859,38608647,2017-04-17T13:10:18Z,"Lovely little cabin in a wonderful area, and Alan's terrific!"
1582859,91720174,2017-04-10T13:39:47Z,"This place was truly magical.. Alan is a wonderful and friendly host- he was gracious enough to show me around the area, tell me about the history behind the property, and even make me blueberry pancakes! The cottage is clean, well equipped, sunny, and has a bunch of neat instruments and knick-knacks to explore. I booked 3 nights here to record some music, and plan on returning in the near future. "
1582859,91192274,2017-04-01T13:16:53Z,Perfect! This cute studio was everything we needed to come home to after a day exploring at Acadia. Sweet loft setup and breathtaking sunrises are some of the highlights. Had an excellent stay here. 
1582859,17791831,2017-03-26T15:11:49Z,We had a wonderful time in Maine! Lovely area and lots of friendly people. Alan was a gracious host--and gave us a wonderful dinner recommendation. 
1582859,3969484,2017-03-19T15:11:00Z,What a delightful cottage. Warm and cozy with spectacular views. Alan is a very caring and helpful host.
1582859,107768359,2017-03-12T13:22:37Z,Adorable cottage with a great location and amazing scenery.
1582859,119011563,2017-03-08T13:04:18Z,"Cabin is as cozy as it looks, and not too far from the nearest town."
1582859,19203567,2017-02-19T13:17:36Z,"What can I say? I booked 3 nights at Alan's cottage to lay groundwork for an album I'm recording, and it couldn't have been a better fit. The (in-tune) piano is certainly the centerpiece, and I think 3 or 4 new songs came from just sitting in front of it. Clean, comfortable and the loft is cozy for able-bodied folk. I will be returning this summer. "
1582859,89503598,2017-02-05T15:02:06Z,Alan's cabin was perfect for a weekend birthday getaway. Would definitely recommend!
1582859,49960899,2017-01-26T13:31:59Z,"Our stay at Alan's place was perfect, exactly what we were looking for. The place was clean and cozy with a cabin in the mountains feel. It was very easy to get to Acadia, just 40 minutes away. We also got a nice dinner in the town of Ellsworth, just a 15 minute drive up the road. Alan has lots of interesting books and beautiful instruments. We could have spent weeks there and had plenty to do. Alan also was a fantastic and attentive host. He gave us a tour of the whole property. Really cared to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. And the stars were incredible!!!"
1582859,104119983,2017-01-20T14:59:40Z,One of the most unique place I have ever been to. Alan was super helpful! 
1582859,3763002,2017-01-15T17:14:45Z,"Alan was an excellent host, who took the time to show us around and inform us of everything there was to see and do in the surrounding area. It was a treat to stay in his cabin, and hope to be back again someday!"
1582859,99995723,2017-01-09T13:40:52Z,Great cabin!
1582859,6853854,2017-01-06T13:29:11Z,"Unforgettable experience! The best Airbnb experience we've ever had.
Alan is a wonderful host, he took care of all of our needs and provided us with all the information needed in order for us to travel around Surry, Acadia National Park, and the surrounding area. 
Alan's coastal Maine cottage is exactly as described, the pictures are accurate, it is an amazing clean cottage with a very hot shower, small kitchen, with music instruments and books. The atmosphere at Alan's place is extremely unique, Alan was such an amazing & fascinating host, he showed us magical places near his cottage, visiting Surry Arts at the Barn (guided by Alan) was impressive and meaningful. 
Even though our visit was off-season there were plenty of interesting activities, beautiful places to visit and attractions. 
We will definitely come back again.
"
1582859,2904437,2017-01-02T15:57:14Z,We had a lovely stay at Alan's for New Years weekend. It was a great cozy spot for a retreat. The house is also very conveniently located for hopping up to Acadia to do some hiking and really close to Blue Hill which has a great food co-op and brewery.
1582859,54327244,2016-12-30T14:53:51Z,"Cozy cabin, great views, kind host. We really enjoyed our stay!"
1582859,102375508,2016-12-24T13:48:00Z,"Great place to get away for a period of time. As a musician I spent most of my time relaxing or working on things, and this was the perfect place to do so. "
2633665,68301494,2017-05-09T06:13:37Z,"Our time at Pietro's was unforgettable! The house was extremely cozy and tranquil, set among olive trees, with a magnificent view of the mountains. Pietro is an authentic and wonderful individual, who made our time very special. He was a wonderful host, greeting us with a bottle of Prosecco and good conversation, making us a reservation at a delicious restaurant on the day of our arrival, and even cooking a meal for us while teaching proper Italian technique in the preparation and eating of spaghetti. I can not say enough about how much we enjoyed our time here. We hope to come back for a longer stay next time. Thank you so very much Pietro for your warmth and hospitality! "
2633665,49347451,2017-05-07T07:43:37Z,This little hobbit style house was amazing. It was such an unusual and exciting experience one night was definitely not long enough for me. The views are amazing and you'll struggle to decide which beautiful area to sit in. The house itself was so much fun with its round hobbit door and tree with stairs going up to the bedroom. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend a stay here. The photos do not come close to doing it justice!
2633665,25832212,2017-05-06T08:21:33Z,"Wanneer weet je of iets de mooiste plek op aarde is? De plek van dit huisje biedt de mooiste uitzichten, rust en ruimte. Het is een plek waar je je volledig kunt terugtrekken uit het dagelijks leven, in een rurale omgeving. Ook onze zoons van 6 en 8 jaar vonden de rust om in het landschap hun spel te vinden. En natuurlijk voor de lieven honden en poezen te zorgen..;-). Pietro is een erg welkome, rustige man, hij heeft in grote mate bijgedragen aan ons heerlijke verblijf.
Misschien goed om te weten: - er zijn geen dekdbedhoezen, maar lakens+dekens, - de bedbank is goed voor kinderen, - het trapje van en naar zolder is niet zomaar beklommen. Het 'buiten' van het huisje is onbeschrijfelijk mooi. Het 'binnen' artistiek en naar italiaanse standaarden.
"
2633665,11126182,2017-05-02T09:45:32Z,"Pietro's is a very special place to stay at.  The accommodations are comfortable and unique, which we loved.  Pietro is very friendly and warm - he is not only your host, but becomes a friend and family.  Pictures also do not do the view justice - it is simply spectacular as you look down upon the valley below and across to several hill towns.  We would love to go back and stay longer there."
2633665,110204146,2017-04-30T07:23:52Z,"La casa tra li ulivi non è solo una casa, ma un'esperienza, un sentiero da percorrere tutto d'un fiato per giungerne fino alla purezza, la genuinità che celano le sue mura. La carica suggestiva di questo luogo non risiede solo nella sua ricercatezza, ma nella sensazione che il tempo si sia fermato appena varcata la sua porta tonda in legno intagliato. Sarebbe inutile trovare parole per esprimere la bellezza della casa, è importante invece capire quello che ti lascia: a partire dall'accoglienza sorridente con cui si sorseggia come vecchi amici il vino con Pietro dopo averlo incontrato dopo pochi minuti, per passare a certi discorsi lunghi davanti alla brace di sera che vorresti non finissero mai, e finendo con la bontà dell'olio che ti regala con il suo sorriso che resta nei ricordi per sempre. 
La bellezza della casa potete vederla nelle foto, che comunque non rendono, ma la vera poesia è Pietro e lo si capisce dal suo mantra: Arte, Terra, Ricettività. E noi ci sentiamo di aggiungere Bellezza.
Ciao Pietro, a presto!"
2633665,117162897,2017-04-28T08:28:30Z,"Dit huis is echt een aanrader als je afgelegen wilt zitten met een fantastisch uitzicht! Er zijn diverse plekken op buiten te zitten. Je kunt genoeg dingen bekijken in de omgeving en het is er totaal niet toeristisch. Heerlijk! We hebben echt genoten. Het is een uur rijden vanaf Airport Champino.
En als je Rome in wilt parkeer je bij het begin van een metrolijn (1,50 euro voor 12 uur!!)
In de avond heerlijk bij de buitenhaard gezeten in een overdekte ruimte en 'ochtends buiten ontbijten op een terrasplaats.
De eigenaar is erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam om bijvoorbeeld een restaurant te reserveren of informatie over de mogelijkheden in de omgeving te geven.
Iets wat wellicht goed is om te weten is dat het bed (matras) om de grond ligt en dat je de slaapkamer alleen via een smalle 'trap' kunt bereiken. Daardoor niet geschikt voor minder valide personen. Je kunt dan wel gebruik maken van een bedbank beneden, maar om de woning te bereiken moet je ook een aantal trappen af.
We raden deze woning zeker aan! "
2633665,20112904,2017-04-23T07:50:50Z,"La casa di Pietro è un posto speciale dove ogni cosa ha un senso e forse una storia. La casa è ricca di particolari curiosi e interessanti, la veduta è mozzafiato, la tenda in mezzo agli ulivi è stata un'esperienza entusiasmante per i miei ragazzi. Se siete in cerca di un posto speciale romantico, intimo e familiare La casa tra li ulivi è ideale. Torneremo sicuramente!"
2633665,22830936,2017-04-22T07:55:05Z,"Pietro is een geweldige gastheer. Attent,  behulpzaam, vriendelijk en  reageert heel snel op je berichten. Het huisje zelf is eenvoudig ingericht. Maar we hebben niets gemist.

Je raakt niet uitgekeken op de details, de vele zitplaatsjes en het uitzicht. Het huisje is met liefde gebouwd, ingericht en 'aangekleed' met  natuurelementen. En overal wordt je weer verrast met kunstzinnigheden. 
Mijn jongste zoon wilde persé in de Tipi ('indianentent') slapen. En Pietro heeft de jongens geleerd met pijl en boog te schieten. 
Door de vele ramen mis je zelfs 's nachts niets van de heldere sterrenhemel. Tenzij je de luiken dicht doet. 

De locatie is gewoon adembenemend. Zo hoog op een heuvel. Heerlijke wijn en olijolie. Je bent even helemaal weg uit je huidige bestaan. Voortdurend buiten. 
Daarnaast kun je naar Rome, in de buurt is ook een groot natuurgebied. 
Dank je Pietro. Tot over vier weken!! Ik kijk ernaar uit.
Suzanne"
2633665,61225104,2017-04-17T08:50:07Z,Die Lage des Hauses ist traumhaft. Überall auf dem Grundstück befinden sich unterschiedliche Sitzmöglichkeiten für jeden Sonnenstand. Das Haus ist gut ausgestattet und bietet beste Voraussetzungen für einen individuellen Urlaub.
2633665,109961712,2017-04-12T09:16:03Z,"Das Haus von Pietro ist einzigartig.
Viele Kleinigkeiten gibt es an jeder Stelle zu entdecken.
Die Lage ist herrlich. Mitten im nichts und doch so wunderschön. Die Aussicht ist der Grandios. Berge, Olivenbäume und kleine Städte. 
Zum Relaxen genau das richtig. 
Aber es gibt auch einige schöne Orte die man besichtigen kann. Allerdings sollte es einem beim Autofahren nicht schlecht werden, da in Bellegra und Umgebung nur Serpentinen sind. ;-)
Pietro ist ein guter Gastgeber, und es war eine tolle zeit bei ihm."
2633665,5204693,2017-04-05T09:56:46Z,"Pietro's place is unique, tranquil and an absolutely beautiful place to relax, unwind and enjoy. Pietro is a warm and genuine host and we felt like family right from the beginning of our visit. He made us feel very warmly welcome and provided us with all the information and tips we needed to explore and enjoy the surrounding area. The cottage was comfortable, spacious and is a wonderfully designed building. Our boy had a great time on the property amongst the trees, in the cottage and teepee. The view was stunning across the valley and we were spoilt for choice on where to enjoy our breakfast view - whether from the cottage itself or the several little tables and other spots to enjoy. We absolutely recommend staying here with Pietro, 100% thumbs up!!!"
2633665,46566600,2017-04-01T09:16:15Z,"What a magical place this is! My wife and I stayed here for our first wedding anniversary with our 8 week old son and it far exceeded all expectations. The setting is absolutely beautiful. We loved having breakfast outside, overlooking the olive grove and watching the sunset with a bottle of Pietro's home made wine. The house is really quirky and cozy with lots of fun features, including a circular door, iron staircase, log fires, a double shower and sauna. Pietro couldn't have done more for us and we really appreciated his kindness and generosity. We arrived just in time as he had gathered some rosemary honey from his bee hives which was delicious! It was a really special stay and we have recommended it to all our friends."
2633665,15393168,2017-03-28T07:42:04Z,"We felt like were experiencing some part of heaven whilst staying in this place.
Pietro is incredibly welcoming as is his wife and their cats and dogs.
The abode is quaint, the door being reminiscent of a Lord of the Rings hobbit's door.
The place is scattered with artistic creations adding even more to the whole experience.
Being high up in the Mountains the air is so tangibly fresh and pure, cleansing all your worries away.
It is a great place to venture from and explore further afield, various towns are nearby where one can experience the wonder of Italian food.
We felt our batteries were recharged and would highly recommend this as a place for anyone to stay.
You couldn't ask for more in a holiday location and the friendliness was all encompassing.
I certainly felt a connection with one of the lovely cats who loved to look at us through the window."
2633665,61495948,2017-03-26T08:23:37Z,"Non è facile scrivere una recensione quando vivi una bella avventura. Non è un viaggio, non è un soggiorno, la casetta di Pietro è vivere una piccola favola senza aspettarselo. Le foto non rispecchiano la magia ed il fascino degli ambienti. Calore, cura nei dettagli...sentirsi a casa. Sì a casa, perché il posto fa la differenza ma anche Pietro è una persona straordinaria. Ci siamo sentiti come se fossimo a casa di una persona cara. Il profumo dei fiori appena arrivi, i cagnolini che ci hanno fatto le feste.  Insomma non si può scrivere una recensione tecnica. Leggerete un sacco di cose positive sui commenti e... perché non si può fare altrimenti. Questo posto è magico. Fortunati coloro che potranno dormire nella meravigliosa stanza da letto e svegliarsi con gli uccellini ed il sole che ti scalda il viso! Grazie Pietro a presto!"
2633665,79936075,2017-03-24T07:12:51Z,"Pietro's was just as awesome as it looks! He was so helpful with figuring out bus/train routes (lots of websites were in Italian), and took us around to see sites near his home. He cooked some meals for us, and had us meet his friends. Although he speaks very little English, we were able to communicate, and it was great getting to learn about each other and share life with each other for a short while. He is a great host. Only downside is it is a process to get to the Rome from his home if you do not have a car-involves bus/metro/train, but if you are comfortable with that it's no problem! My husband and I figured it out and we're very glad for the experience to stay with Pietro. "
2633665,11091021,2017-03-20T07:04:18Z,"Great host! Greeted us very kindly with some wine and biscuits. Showed us to our cabin which was amazing and just what we wanted. He said if we needed anything just to ask, but we felt like we were alone the whole time which is just what we wanted. Our own privacy with an amazing view, welcoming animals and a helping hand if needed!"
2633665,111935055,2017-03-08T09:07:30Z,"     We had a wonderful two night visit at Pietro's.  As all the other reviewers have stated, the house and grounds are incredibly beautiful.  Pietro is an artisan extraordinaire.  The attention to detail with regard to the house alone is amazing-- from the gorgeous chestnut woodwork to the stonework and intricate carvings that adorn both the interior and exteriors.  And did I mention that views are simply stunning?  Jaw dropping, that is.  
     As a host, Pietro went above and beyond what was needed to make us feel at home.  He was simply fabulous.  Upon arrival, he welcomed us into his home, offered us wine, cheese and salami along with great conversation.  On top of that, the house was more than well equipped with a wide assortment of breakfast food.   Pietro helped us immensely-- from directions to lunch reservations and beyond.  As Americans, we needed a bit of help.
   We loved staying at Pietro's.   You will too.  This is a host who makes a return visit very likely,
"
2633665,58966306,2017-03-05T07:06:08Z,Conoscere Pietro e il suo angolo di paradiso è stata un'esperienza stupenda. La casa sembra uscita da un libro di Tolkien ed è il posto ideale per uscire dal caos della città e passare del tempo stupendo con gli amici. Ha reso il giorno del mio compleanno un'esperienza indimenticabile. Grazie Pietro! :))
2633665,44851792,2017-03-01T09:15:05Z,"Das außergewöhnliche Haus von Pietro, liegt ruhig schön in mitten eines Olivenbaumgarten. Die verschieden Sitzgelegenheiten rund um das Haus verteilt, sind einfach ein Traum! Natur und Erholung pur! In der Küche fanden wir alles was wir zum kochen brauchten. Besonders toll fanden wir, das uns Pietro (Unsere Anreise war am Sonntag) Tost, Mich, Butter und Marmelade für unser erstes Frühstück bereitstellte. Pietro gab uns wertvolle Tips für unsere Ausflüge. MOLTO BENE!  "
2633665,116798493,2017-02-26T08:20:06Z,"La realtà ha superato le nostre aspettative. Se le foto sono già bellissime, la casa e l'ambiente lo sono ancora di più. L'accoglienza del signor Pietro è sicuramente ciò che fa la differenza: è stato gentilissimo, ci ha accolti con del buon vino e una crostata fatta in casa per scambiare due chiacchiere e conoscerci un po' e l'atmosfera è diventata subito familiare. 
Il trinomio ""ARTE-TURISMO-RISTORAZIONE"" è il mantra della casa. Ma nessuna recensione potrebbe rendere al meglio quello che è davvero. Quindi, senza nessun dubbio, il nostro consiglio è andate e apprezzate voi stessi! Noi speriamo di ritornare presto!!"
576484,4122299,2017-05-07T07:32:31Z,"Humac and the stone home were enchanting! If there is one place to stay on your vacation to Croatia, come here! It is the perfect spot if you like nature, walks on pebble roads, drinking wine, and rustic accommodation. My 2 yr old loved playing outside all day. We came during off season and we really didn't see anyone else except a few passersby. We were close enough to Jelsa and Stari Grad (15-20 minutes by car driving slow) yet far enough to feel we were the only ones in island. 
Mario's family's left us with some home dried figs, candied orange peels, and homegrown wine which we all delicious! 
We would love to come back here one day!"
576484,12589490,2017-04-29T13:26:25Z,Amazing place. So cosy and well looked after it felt like home straight away. The location is fantastic and even though we weren't lucky with the weather we still had a fantastically relaxing time. The wifi worked perfectly and the log burning stove kicks out the heat. Though if the sun had been out you wouldn't have needed it. Loved this cottage. 
576484,112371918,2017-04-22T09:43:28Z,"Wer ausspannen will, ist hier am richtigen Ort.
Wenn man aus einer Millionenmetropole kommt, ist die Ruhe in der Nacht schon erschreckend, im positiven Sinne. 
Zum Glück gab es genug Holz im Schuppen, da es Abends doch sehr kalt wurde aber zu dieser Jahreszeit ist das auch nicht anders zu erwarten.
Umgebung, Unterkunft und Aussicht waren sehr schön !
Ich würde wieder dort hinfahren und das Meer ist ja auch nicht weit weg. :)"
576484,4294690,2017-04-18T07:36:38Z,"This is a fantastic, secluded house that has the best view on the island! There is plenty of space to go for walks and our dog loved it too. Was nice to get away from it all and enjoy the peace and quiet. Highly recommend!"
576484,11661895,2017-04-13T09:05:25Z,"Marios house in Humac offers a great place for Hvar tourists. The nicely renovated house and the spectacular view over Jelsa and adriatic sea is a great combination :)
Mario offered lots of tips for our stay.

576484,64657061,2017-03-16T10:12:31Z,"Humac est un endroit incroyable et magnifique: au milieu des lavandes, avec une vue sur la mer, dans un village chargé d' histoire. Mario et son frère nous ont partagé cet endroit en nous mettant à l'aise."
576484,46575423,2016-11-29T07:59:09Z,Ein wunderbarer Ort auch bei Regen und Sturm im November!

576484,1997717,2016-09-08T03:09:12Z,"Mario und sein Bruder sind sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeber. Jeder Wunsch wurde sofort erfüllt und oben drauf gab es auch noch sehr guten Wein aus eigener Produktion geschenkt. Das Haus und der Garten sind top - mit ein paar Insekten mussten wir zwar klar kommen, wir haben uns aber sehr wohl gefühlt. "
576484,11553959,2016-09-03T00:44:40Z,"Mario and Jakov were so welcoming and accommodating to my family! House, patio and outdoor bathroom/shower were well kept and clean. Sunsets and stars were wonderful from the hammock and lounge chairs. We did the tour of Humac and the cave with Jakov, which was very interesting and got to see the lavender distillery which was awesome and so unique. Konoba Humac is a wonderful place, (and you can walk home in case you drink too much wine.) highly recommend it--make sure you tell them one day in advance to get pekva, which is slow cooked meat and veggies under a clay lid. Yum!  Mario helped us find a boat rental to Bol, it was prompt and reasonable. We made many great memories at Humac and on Hvar and Brac. We hope to return someday. Thanks Mario and Jakov!"
576484,844982,2016-08-30T07:38:55Z,"This is an old an fully restored stone house with a bedroom and a loft. There is also a dining area with a separate entrance, but we never used it because we ate and hung out outside. The property itself is beautiful and very large, with amazing views.

Mario is a great host, very easy to communicate with. His brother Jakov met us at the house. Jakov is also a tourist guide and knows a lot about Humac and the surrounding area."
576484,36291991,2016-08-10T02:12:25Z,"We just finished our 2 days trip in HVAR and the house is the most fabulous we ever rented ! The view during sunset is incredible and the house is very quiet. The kids Also loved it !!! 

Mario and Jacov has been very nice welcoming hosts. We re looking forward to come back !"
576484,7695038,2016-08-01T06:23:51Z,What a perfect house on an amazing location! Also the island is very beautiful. It does get reather hot in summer without airco.
576484,31399109,2016-07-24T01:55:49Z,Maison très bien située avec un superbe vue sur les champs de lavande et la mer. Magnifiques coucher de soleil en été. Bon restaurant juste à côté. Mario est un hôte très accueillant et sympathique. A recommander !
576484,2337603,2016-07-17T00:18:40Z,"Jacob, Mario and their Family were great hosts. We loved the experience of staying in their house in Humac. They are very genuine and offer us great hospitality. We would love to come back again. Great lavanda lands and great sunsets were enjoyed from the house while having dinner. Jacob also offers a tour to the yowns and the (URL HIDDEN) is great for adukts and kids. They offered us lavanda oil and also their own wine."
576484,473824,2016-07-14T10:51:06Z,"This is a very unique and lovely retreat, especially considering how crazy busy Hvar town and the rest of the island is during high season. Mario was a great host. The location and cottage are utterly charming but it's a touch more rustic than we were anticipating given the price and photos. The konoba and village just behind the cottage are well worth visiting. Three things detracted from our experience: 1) There were wasps everywhere outside, so we didn't last long sitting out even though this is one of the loveliest aspects of this listing, and the view is incredible. 2) We underestimated the heat, and the lack of air conditioning was brutal - although a fan helped. Would not recommend staying here during the hot summer months unless you are well accustomed to +30 C days. 3) The kitchen could use a few better knives and higher-quality cooking implements, and the fridge doesn't operate super well, so it was tough to keep food and beverages cold. All told we enjoyed the novelty of it but were ready to leave for cooler accommodations at the end. Would be a great spot in the shoulder season as long as you're not expecting anything too fancy. "
576484,27231366,2016-07-03T00:03:05Z,"This a fantastic spot If you seek calm days well away from buisy towns and crowds. We found it relaxing and a great place for bicycling and running. The Island of Hvar is not particularly Large and ""secret"" secret beaches can be found close by. Beaches with restaurants are also noumerous on both sides of the island. In Humac you will be the only family, expect for The family running the very friendly restaurant in town."
576484,40513639,2016-06-26T02:14:00Z,"Mario searched contact to make sure he knew how late we arrived and so that we could find the place, which was great. Brilliant location! On the pictures you don't even see the view which sells the house. You can see the island and the ocean from the great outdoor shower! We'll never forget it. Place is very secluded, nobody lives in Humac but you, this wasn't clean for is at first, but with a car no problem. It's an eco house which means rainwater as water heated by sun panels, no airco, no dishwasher or washing machine. No problem, but good to know. Second bedroom is on the vide en quite hot. Furthermore house is very basic, only two cooking pits and not a lot of indoor space. Furniture or at least decoration/bedlinnen is quite old. Nevertheless the enormous outdoor space with the view and lavander maken it unique and certainly a place we can recommend!"
576484,33484104,2016-06-07T10:22:31Z,"Mario was really good host, the house was very special and it has an amazing views, and there is a lovely terrace With lavanda fields around, the property is very close to the main road and very easy to find. I will come back for sure!"

Good range of kitchen facilities. There was nothing else we needed. Many places to eat nearby. Everywhere very cheap! We mainly came to explore Krakow, Auschwitz and the salt mines. Tour guides picked us up outside the apartment. Many thanks for having us."

Auch due Wohnung an sich ist super interessant eingerichtet und sauber. Am besten hat mir aber die Gastfreundschaft gefallen. Mir wurde direkt nach dem Buchen Infos über Krakau zugeschickt und auch beim einchecken hat alles Problemlos geklappt. Wenn ich nochmal nach Krakau fahre, würde ich die Unterkunft direkt nochmal buchen.

1473374,36192071,2017-03-18T09:28:35Z,"Bartek's flat is a great choice for a stay in the city. It's walking distance or a very cheap cab from the station.  It's very close to the main square and despite the central location it's actually very quiet.  There is also a mini market nearby and one of the restaurants Bartek recommended (literally 20 seconds walk) was fabulous for breakfast and dinner.  

There are a lot of steps up to the apartment so it wouldn't be suitable for everyone. The actual apartment is well equipped and the old fashioned bath is great.  

Bartek was super helpful.  We had to ammend our booking when our travel plans changed but this was done really easily and you really can sleep 4 people in the apartment! We arrived very late from Warsaw but Bartek sent through very clear instructions and his recommendations were fab. "
1473374,56683948,2017-03-13T09:35:25Z,Amazing apartment. Brilliant location very clean and quirky. Bartek was a dab host making the trip very easy and his sightseeing tips were spot on!

2207040,51123478,2017-05-07T02:17:37Z,"Daigo's cabin is comfortable & stunningly beautiful 

We arrived by catching the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Sakudaira station, then jumped in the Koumi line to hagaroshita station (both trains were JR). Daigo picked us up from Hagaroshita Train station, arriving right on time.

He then took us to the shopping market on the way. The shop had a really good variety of things - quite large for a small town. Alcohol here include sake, wine, beer and spirits. We were able to refrigerate so keep that in mind at the shop. We bought pasta for one night, the sauce and spaghetti and fresh tomatoes.

Facilities at the cabin include a fridge (cabin is solar powered), gas powered stoves, pots, pans, cups salt etc etc, indoor outdoor dining tables and chairs, and a comfortable and warm bed. After exploring around the cabin you soon realise Daigo has really thought of everything. He even had mosquito burning coils, a travel sized toothbrush and paste and a deck of cards. There were books (in English and Japanese) including a book on amazing cabins across the globe (quite fitting). 

Daigo was very kind, spoke good English and offered to take us into town to shower but we had wet wipes we brought from home, and there is fresh towels and water to wash yourself and did not need to.

We came in early May and did not need the heaters, perfect temperature in the cabin with two of us, and closing the windows at night. The view is breathtaking from the cabin.

There's a shop close by that is quite small, we found cigarettes (unknown brands) and a few cold drinks but not much else.

All in all it made our trip to Japan even more memorable, and I would definitely recommend coming to Daigo's cabin. "
2207040,3712441,2017-04-30T23:38:14Z,"It was one of my best Airbnb experience. I was so used to live in the city with lots of busy things, so when I found this off the grid house, I thought this house could be the one I can really relax away from all the phone call, emails, and internet, and it really was! House is really lovely, and perfect place to be relax, find peace of mind away from busy life. Even though there is no shower in the house, it actually makes it even easier to be relaxed. We drove to nearby Onsen to take a bath and amazing scenery of mountain was a bonus. Daigo kindly prepared coffee bean, so it was really pleasure to brew coffee every morning and have a cup of coffee with sounds of birds and view of the trees and mountains. 
Staying 2 nights in this off the grid house really change my perception about consumption and environment as well. You will find how to live gracefully with minimum resource by staying at this house. I highly recommend to stay at this house and looking forward to visit again in near future! :) 
Thanks! "

2207040,35460101,2017-04-21T02:25:39Z,Absolutely loved our 3 nights at Daigo's place. The Location is out of the way but that's part of its charm and a good chance to get off the tourist path. Daigo was very helpful and accomodating and had some great recommendations for local places to eat. We were blow away by the lunch set at Maru Cafe  
2207040,61043989,2017-04-18T01:38:18Z,Friends recommended we stay here and it didn't disappoint. The location is beautiful and Daigo's place is a wonderful place to relax. it is simple but everything has been thought of making it a comfortable stay. Daigo was an excellent host. Highly recommend! 
2207040,160157,2017-04-15T02:06:48Z,Great place. I would go back in each season to experience it in different versions!
2207040,7838103,2017-04-12T23:02:36Z,"Daigo & Keisuke are amazing hosts. They are both very helpful and generous. We took the train in from Tokyo, and they had a woman that works at the train station greet us. We were able to keep our bags with her while we walked to the supermarket. Keisuke brought us to the cabin and daigo stopped by to show us how everything worked. 

The cabin is wonderful with beautiful views. We spent time walking along the many trails behind the cabin. Daigo also took us to a local onsen, and we hiked up to a nearby shrine. It's a very charming place, and we highly suggest that people stay here when visiting Japan. "
2207040,42913334,2017-04-09T01:07:10Z,"The cottage is located on the edge of a pine forest, overlooking the mountains in the distance. 
Every detail has been thoroughly considered, and occupants' needs are accommodated for even before they arise.
Keisuke and Daigo are exceptional hosts, going above and beyond what is expected of them.
A wonderful, quiet place to relax for 2 to 3 day after sightseeing in Tokyo; I highly recommend staying here. "
2207040,2889647,2017-04-02T02:23:21Z,"Even if the cabin is exactly has described, it turns out to be even better, because the experience you live there is just not   describable! Daigo has thought of everything and he's here to help at any time. As some other people said, I wish we could have stayed longer, and I wish we could come back soon!"
2207040,5647074,2017-03-28T02:02:31Z,"Daigo's cabin was perfect, simple and cozy. The little fireplace combined with the snow and the views were magical. Diago picked us up and dropped us back to our train. He's a legend. Best AirBNB we've stayed in by far! Truely spectacular!! "
2207040,60431338,2017-03-26T01:50:49Z,"余計な物の無い、落ち着いた(内心ワクワクもしながら)時間を過ごさせていただきました。
暖炉の力強い温もりに感謝して、明け方には予期せぬ雪景色も楽しむことができました。
また次回、今度はテラスで食事が楽しめる時期にお邪魔したいと思います。
どうもありがとうございました。"
2207040,108692505,2017-03-23T01:36:12Z,A tiny cottage that you must experience to live out of the city! The stars were shinning brightly at night and you can grace from the 2nd floor with the opentable window. Just an amazing wooden house!!
2207040,105557941,2017-03-22T00:39:06Z,"Daigo's cottage offers a very rare and memorable experience. We stayed here for two nights and were surprised with snow fall over night. The cottage is exactly what we were looking for. It is comfortable, functional and surrounded by beautiful natural scenery. Daigo was an excellent, kind and generous host. An amazing experience, we hope to visit again. "
2207040,19892785,2017-03-20T02:14:07Z,薪ストーブなど貴重な経験ができました。
2207040,43390587,2017-03-19T00:49:39Z,手作りコテージは、作り手の方の想いが詰まった素敵な空間でした。食器やインテリアも可愛く、センスがよいです。大自然の中で過ごす静かな時間は贅沢でした。薪ストーブは初挑戦だっため、最初は苦戦しましたが、思ったより暖かかったです。星空がとても綺麗でした。
2207040,25258564,2017-03-07T00:34:05Z,"Daigo's place was great! Cozy and secluded. We really enjoyed the cottage, campfire and view of the mountains. 

If driving from Tokyo, beware the possibility of snow/ice on roads. "
2207040,41032237,2017-03-05T23:31:28Z,"This was the best place I stayed in during my one month trip to Japan. Daigo is an excellent host and boasts a lovely, secluded cabin experience in the Japanese countryside. An easy recommendation for anyone visiting the country."
2207040,4706393,2017-03-02T23:45:37Z,"We had a super duper time at Daigo's place. The little cabin is an absolute dream. You can tell it was built with a lot of care and love. It was such a unique experience, one we are guaranteed to not forget! We are already talking about coming back and staying a while. It's the perfect romantic getaway. We couldn't recommend it any more! Thank you Daigo & Keisuke! <3"
2207040,41958199,2017-02-28T23:55:57Z,"Beautiful cabin in the forest, in quiet mountainous area of Japan.  Utterly relaxing and a wonderful escape from the hustle of Tokyo.   Daigo was an excellent host and his hot showers a quick hop away if you tire of going pioneer for a few days.  "
2207040,24020661,2017-02-25T02:26:39Z,"This is one of the most beautiful places I've been to. Daigo was an excellent host, picking us up and dropping us at the train station nearby for check in/check out. The location is gorgeous and the perfect retreat from the fast pace of the city. Would highly recommend. "
577410,117443874,2017-05-09T17:00:59Z,"This place is perfect for a couple's get away. Close enough to town for a quick trip to the store, but when you're sitting on the porch or walking the trails on the property you feel like you're a million miles away from civilization. The hot tub, outdoor shower, fire pit and grill make it easy to be outside enjoying the scenery. Loved having the fresh-from-the-coup eggs in the fridge as a nice surprise! We'll definitely be back together. And I'm also making plans for a solo stay to catch up on some reading and writing.  "
577410,79639507,2017-04-30T14:56:31Z,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  Would definitely come back.
577410,101209658,2017-04-26T16:50:35Z,"This is one little cozy, comfortable place to stay that is 5 minutes from Wimberley and 5 minutes from the most winery!  We had 6 fresh eggs waiting for us in our refrigerator, a cozy fire pit with fire wood, a charcoal BBQ grill and all of the utensils, pots and pans needed to cook. There's a creek that is a short little hike from the camper and you can see fish swimming in the clear water. The owners never bothered us. There's a super nice hot tub and an amazing outdoor shower. You won't regret staying here!"
577410,37188420,2017-04-16T13:59:51Z,"My bf and I traveled here from Austin for a weekend getaway and it was exactly what we needed. We only left the property for dinner one night (The Leaning Pear so good). Spent most of the time relaxing on the deck playing board games, grilling, laying in the hammock, and hiking around the grounds. The outdoor shower is fantastic at night to view the stars. Highly recommend the Dixie daisy! "
577410,106136285,2017-04-10T13:40:41Z,Jennifer and Gregory's airstream was the perfect way to kick off our honeymoon! 
577410,13040300,2017-03-31T13:53:55Z,"This was my second time staying at the Dixie Daisy. It's such a cute place and just as fun the second time around. Jennifer and Gregory are great hosts. We got there a little early so texted them to see if could check in ahead of schedule and they texted back immediately that it wasn't a problem. They are very responsive and brought us an extra blanket when we were a little chilly. 
I had more time to explore Wimberly and the surrounding areas this time and all of their recommendations were really great. It's a super cute town with lots of interesting boutiques. The Leaning Pear was great for dinner and everyone we met was very friendly. The area is beautiful just to drive around. I highly recommend the Dixie Daisy!"
577410,119781186,2017-03-21T14:20:26Z,FANTASTIC!  WHAT A WONDERFUL PLACE.  EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO VISIT - SIT BACK - RELAX AND ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL AREA. 
577410,81889641,2017-03-03T15:05:29Z,"Very clean and cheery place. Everything we needed was there--fire pit, grill, hot tub right off deck.  Lovely private spot."
577410,36430368,2017-02-21T15:09:38Z,Place was incredible! The lot if land the airstream is on was amazing. You basically have your own Creek to hang out at.
577410,31930733,2017-02-12T18:33:11Z,"Perfect setting for a peaceful getaway! We enjoyed the airstream's funky retro flair with a western twist complete with chenille bedspread and vintage cowgirl curtains. The hot tub, walking trails, tree house, hammock, outdoor shower, and creek access added to the enjoyment of our trip! One of our favorite things was sitting on the deck in the morning enjoying coffee provided by the owners and listening to the birds chirp. Of course a little time in the hot tub then hammock followed this! The location is secluded yet very close to the shops and restaurants in Wimberley, just a short drive away. Every detail of the rental is well thought out down to the handmade mosaic stepping stones leading to the camper, hand drawn map of the property, and hand picked music, games, and books provided inside the camper. We really enjoyed our trip and look forward to returning! "
577410,35979498,2017-02-09T15:11:14Z,"Great place, only an hour from Austin, secluded and scenic. The airstream is super cute and nice, and the sunset on the deck was beautiful. We'll definitely be back!"
577410,461019,2017-02-05T15:06:29Z,"I booked the Dixie Daisy for our anniversary weekend getaway and it was the perfect place to get away from it all (the kids!) and spend time reconnecting with one another. We loved the outdoor shower (big enough for two!) and the hot tub as well. We also enjoyed exploring the lovely property that the Dixie Daisy is located on. The  eggs and coffee were a nice touch and we loved the charm of the airstream itself. It was nice and cozy and we were serenaded by Willie, Lyle and Patsy during our stay! Jennifer and Gregory were very quick to reply to any question I had up to and including our time there. 

One thing to be aware of is that the property can be a bit difficult to find, especially if you are arriving at night, but Jennifer provided turn-by-turn directions, which was very helpful. Also, the speed limit is 60 mph on the road the property is located off of, so you can hear the cars passing by from the airstream, but it's not terrible by any means. 

The weather was dreary and overcast during our stay, so we weren't able to see any stars at night this time, but we look forward to a return visit in the near future! Thanks again Jennifer and Gregory for providing such a charming place! "
577410,97615259,2017-01-29T15:04:11Z,"Cute renovated Airstream in a secluded location, with lovely trails down to Smith Creek.  There's lots to do in the Wimberley area, and this is a very peaceful place to rest your weary head at the end of the day!"
577410,11934346,2017-01-27T17:21:15Z,"What a great way to get away from it all! A wonderful trip for one or a couple! Rustic, charming accommodations in the Hill Country. Definitely recommend!"
577410,5023467,2017-01-25T16:24:15Z,"Such a great spot to experience all Wimberley and the surrounding area has to offer! Spend all your time relaxing around the airstream or venture out to the local shops and eateries. Either way, Jennifer and Gregory's place is a perfect getaway."
577410,71780298,2017-01-15T16:02:08Z,The Dixie Daisy was everything we hope for and more! It's the perfect place to get away from it all! We will definitely be visiting again! 
577410,96223621,2017-01-06T15:53:17Z,"This place is wonderful. I would and have suggested this place to people. I think we agreed to buy an airstream by the fourth hour of our stay.

The location could not be more perfect! Nestled in the clearing of some awesomely, tall and unfamiliar trees. Ariel said something about pines, but I don't think I heard her correctly.
The hot tub in January was a dream, and because it is Texas even the outdoor shower was available for a day.

Making fajitas on the Firepit with the grill grate was tight, we totally forgot to clear the ashes from the pit. I just remember. SO SORRY GREG AND JEN

Oops, hope we are still allowed to comeback because we definitely plan to.

The limestone ledge and what was probably a quarter mile stretch of river bank was awesome to explore and collect a rock or two. We did a bit of yoga but there was also a canoe...didn't get a chance to ask if it was available to use, but if it is, we are pretty excited to try it out.

Wimberly was equally as fun with a very active square to walk around and explore. There is a market that runs from march to December that we were bummed we missed out on.

And San Marcos was basically in spitting distance too. The late menu bangs hard.

Overall I think it's pretty obvious we enjoyed our first bnb experience.

S/O to Greg and Jen. And the leaning , and the sweet collab by the restaurant and Jen's studio!! Didn't take nearly enough pictures and that is enough reason to come back but seeing how close the community seems to be will definitely find us returning to wimberly."
577410,103819221,2017-01-04T17:37:59Z,"It was great! I would recommend if you are looking for something semi remote, with some nearby hiking, with a hot tub near wineries and good food. It was also a plus that we got to bring our dogs. "
577410,44881251,2017-01-02T16:18:55Z,"Cozy, private, getaway with all the luxuries to relax the time away. Loved every minute we had here. "
577410,29383,2016-12-30T17:05:35Z,"This place is so special that I'm almost reluctant to review it, for fear of letting the secret out. Do yourself and your lovey a favor and spend some time in the hot tub airstream. You won't regret it."
79713,41566606,2017-04-20T12:59:06Z,"这是坐落于卡萨布兰卡的一座艺术花园,特别美,交通方便,周围环境也很好。这边大概是卡萨布兰卡的富人区,除了花园本身十分优美之外,周围的房子也很值得欣赏。到这个城市的景点都只需要十几分钟十几迪拉姆。
在这里每晚都休息的很好,第二天有丰盛的摩洛哥早餐,Cristina会给很艺术性的这个城市的游玩意见。
一座会向所有人推荐的房子,就如房东说的,这会是你在卡萨布兰卡的家。"
79713,19356137,2017-04-18T08:16:46Z,We think Cristina's Oasis is one of the best BNB experiences anyone could have! She has created an extremely comfortable and enjoyable place to stay while in Casablanca.  She provides an amazing array of information and offers terrific help with whatever we needed.  We look forward to returning.
79713,34111972,2017-04-10T08:45:20Z,"Cristina has a very beautiful and clean house which located quiet close to most of the main spots in Casablanca. She was very friendly and gave lots of helpful information during our stay. If anyone wants to live a ""Casablanca sense of life"", this is definitely your first choice!! Anyway, we pretty much enjoyed our stay! Thank you so much!!!"
79713,54503331,2017-04-08T13:20:06Z,Cristina's place is incredible!  Beautiful flowers and greenery.  Very welcoming and super helpful.  Casablanca was a random detour due to change in our flight schedule and thankfully we found Cristina's place.  Loved every moment and can't wait to go back!
79713,42546427,2017-04-02T09:35:52Z,"Cristina is a very kind, friendly,elegant ,generous and nice host. The position of this house is very nice and there is a big supermarket within walking distance. And she gives us a lot of travel information and even gives us a plan! Hope to see you again!"
79713,29114838,2017-03-28T07:45:34Z,"Cristina's house was a very nice spot to start our Morocco trip. Very calm and safe neighborhood. Her house is beautiful and very well furnished. Cristina was able to provide us all kind of information,  which we needed. Would definitely recommend her as a good host."
79713,13351033,2017-03-27T08:12:03Z,"Cristina's house is absolutely gorgeous, the interior is amazing and there's a swimming pool in the garden. Cristina is a wonderful host, she arranged a driver to pick me up at the airport and greeted me at the house, she also took me for a walking tour in the city and it was great! I love her house so much that after I visited Marrakech and came back to Casablanca, I lived at her house again. I highly recommend this place! "
79713,27070129,2017-03-26T08:10:44Z,房子很大 适合家人朋友出来玩入住 周围也都是别墅 很安静 每天早上都有人来做早餐 推荐

79713,39632982,2017-03-11T10:12:57Z,"Très belle maison dans un quartier très chic, et en même temps bucolique. Une jolie chambre (et un grand lit très confortable) avec salle de bain partagée , (ne prenez pas la douche en dernier ou gare à l'eau chaude) bel accueil de Cristina et de son personnel. Itinéraires en taxi très faciles depuis ou vers le centre ville ou la plage. Une belle adresse pour une étape décontractée! Je reviendrai volontiers "
79713,3164345,2017-03-09T10:06:17Z,"Une véritable oasis de paix et de tranquillité, loin du tumulte de la ville mais à 10 Minutes du centre ville ! 
La maison de Cristina est magnifique, un endroit réellement apaisant et très très agréable !
Nous saurons ou revenir lors de notre prochain voyage à Casa, merci beaucoup Cristina !"
79713,26473659,2017-03-05T09:41:53Z,"Cristina is extremely kind and generous, as soon as we arrived she gave us a tour of the home and showed us where to go on the map. The home/room was extremely comfortable and we actually ended up making friends with another couple who was staying there as well. The highlight was definitely the bathroom. The shower was a gorgeous large open style rain shower with a window that opened to the garden, it was hard to get out! Thank you Cristina for an outstanding experience in Casablanca.

79713,61474239,2017-03-03T10:40:09Z,"Cristina er et meget gæstfrit, hjælpsomt og opmærksomt menneske med et stort ønske om at man får et behageligt ophold i såvel hendes bolig som i Casablanca. "
79713,11493351,2017-02-21T10:31:14Z,"Cristina's Oasis in Casablanca is exactly that. It is an Oasis where you can escape, and with the help of Cristiana it is just amazing. If your traveling alone I highly recommend staying here. She is extremely helpful, and if she's out of town, there is always someone else that is available to assist. The photos do not do the house justice, it is breathtaking in person. It is also very clean and tidy. The beach is a short run from her house and is very safe. I ran at the crack of dawn and didn't feel threatened for a sec. she also had a very tasty homemade breakfast ready for me and had arranged a taxi when I got back. Just in time for  me to leave for the airport. I will be coming back to Casablanca and staying with Cristina."
79713,29262252,2017-02-19T09:37:50Z,"Cristina's place was wonderful! My sister who is an interior designer really loved every details of the house. The house is quiet near the center. She made sure everything was taken care of. Unfortunately, we havent met her coz she's not around during our stay but she's quick in anwesring our queries and addressing our problems. I will recommend her place to friends and colleagues who are planning to visit Casablanca. "
79713,4381466,2017-02-16T08:45:52Z,Cristina was very responsive in times of need. She was also super helpful in assisting me to arrange a taxi on the way there from the airport (even with me asking her first)! I truly enjoyed my stay in her place. Highly recommend her place when someone visits Morocco.
79713,40477019,2017-02-12T11:32:23Z,"房间宽敞、干净,与图片完全一致。与Cristina的沟通很顺畅,她回复很迅速、及时。Cristina还帮忙预订出租车、推荐餐厅,生病时还找人帮忙买药,十分感谢她。"

7490413,67268978,2017-05-06T08:24:23Z,"挺棒,位置很好,很有特色,古色古香但不很陈旧,算是有趣的体验和回忆。
需要注意的是,上下楼比较黑稍显不便,以及洗澡花洒的方向有点问题,其他都还好。
"
7490413,126971880,2017-05-04T06:57:14Z,"房子位于苏州老市中心位置,相当于北京东西城的胡同。离平江路100米,观前街300米,拙政园苏州博物馆1.8公里,要体验老苏州的感觉,这个位置和房子是绝佳的选择。最重要的是居住在这里自由度极高,与房主几乎见不了面,不用担心房主每日在家尤其很多退休老人,时时刻刻见面,腾拿挪移的那种不自在感,房主是年轻人,因为自由度高,所以那种信任感也油然而生。设备设施很家居化,比较完善。如果要说缺点就一点点,建议胆子小的不要单身居住,因为是老宅子,房主又不在家,那种寂静有那么一刻我觉得有点害怕,我们是一家三口,就那么一会儿就过去了。"
7490413,120873404,2017-05-01T02:32:50Z,"一进门就见到房东姐姐的儿子,超可爱的儿。虽然已经在网上见过房间的样子了,但是一进去见到的时候还是觉得好好看,一见就很心水的那种,房间的个个细节都能看出房东装饰时候的用心,各种设施也很齐全。而且房东姐姐人超好的。
房间的地段也超好,离平江路和观前街都很近,交通也很方便。反正就超棒的儿。"
7490413,107515744,2017-04-29T02:51:28Z,"房间的位置不是很准确,是位于大约一层半的房间,在客厅边的一个楼梯下去,厕所在边上。隔音不是很好,早上5点多就可以听到楼上传来的脚步声,中午的时候可以听到附近学校(?)传来的声音。厕所是和房东共用的。到达房东家要走一条木楼梯,没有灯。房子的位置很方便,公交站和景点很近,边上就是公安局很安全。床非常舒服,睡眠质量很好。"
7490413,126464043,2017-04-25T05:34:16Z,"老板人很好,房间超级干净整洁!床很舒服!就是有两点要提示以后的房客:一是房子是老房子,挺有年代的房子,像我这种喜欢老房子的就很满意,但如果你和我妈妈一样不太喜欢老房子,那就要三思了;二是房子里有三扇小窗户,分别是朝东南西三个方向,但由于朝南的小窗户外是一个小空间,会遮挡阳光,三扇窗子又比较小,介意采光的房客要注意了。但房主客厅里的窗户还是很大的,通风也很好。总体感觉很不错,性价比很高,就在平江路里面。"
7490413,68585058,2017-04-23T01:22:14Z,"我最喜欢的是厨房小阳台。 小禾最喜欢爬楼梯,各种爬;还爱沙发上的一溜毛绒玩具,睡前醒来都要挨个摸摸。房子很得江南园林的启发,各处借窗户造景,有窗房子就有灵气。我们的房间能看日出的,哈哈,从青砖屋顶上看一枚橘红的太阳从纱帘里透出暖暖的红光真是很好呀。"
7490413,60171547,2017-04-12T01:27:48Z,床睡得真的超超超超舒服 一出来就是平江路 风景优美 房东姐姐超温柔 下次还想再来

We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this lovely apartment, we stayed from Fri to Monday. Mihyang was most helpful and kind all throughout our booking and up to the day we arrived to her apartment she let us drop off our bags before check in time as she was getting the apartment ready for us which we really appreciated. This was a great help as we were then able to get our bearings, have lunch and get some necessary groceries. The apartment building has an elevator so you don't have to haul your luggage up 3 flights of stairs. For the size of this studio it has everything that you would need for a weekend break and the fact that there was shampoo and shower gel provided was a big help as it saved on our luggage weight and having to buy these items to be left behind. We agree with all the excellent reviews that are here and cannot add much more than has already been said BUT bear in mind as others have said the night time NOISE can be a big issue and as we were there at the weekend this might be worse than during the week nights. We were aware of this as we had read the previous reviews but we did not realise that it went on till 6am as there are bars and restaurants on this pedestrianized street and it gets so loud that earplugs will not help in any way. We know it's the culture in Madrid to stay out late but not this late so be prepared for this if you are staying here for the weekend. It is mentioned that there is tempered glass windows for soundproofing but not strong enough as we had to get up to check if the balcony doors were closed tightly and so they were so that did not prevent the noise. Other than that issue we had a great time in this apartment and a most comfortable bed to sleep!
"
3058631,4782152,2017-04-28T06:57:19Z,"You can't ask for a better-located apartment in Madrid. Less than 5 minute walk from Puerta del Sol and a great selection of tapas bars close by. Mihyang was great at answering our many questions prior to our arrival and even let us drop our bags early before check-in. There was a bit of street noise, but that's to be expected with such a central location; nothing a pair of ear plugs won't fix though. "
3058631,27094328,2017-04-26T09:11:00Z,Great studio and location to explore Madrid - exactly as publicised.
3058631,13372072,2017-04-25T08:10:44Z,"Great place to stay. Clean, easy to find and right in the middle of everything. The bottle of wine made the welcome even better!"
3058631,58123350,2017-04-22T06:31:11Z,"Mihyang and Juan Antonio's home was wonderful. It was a very comfortable place to stay for my several day visit in Madrid. The pictures depicted the layout and feel of the apartment very well, though I was pleasantly surprised to discover just how vibrant the surrounding area was. 

Mihyang and Juan Antonio were very responsive and helpful for checking in, and Juan Antonio was kind enough to help me figure out how to watch a Real Madrid game. This is a great place to stay if you want to be in the center of everything Madrid has to offer."
3058631,41359389,2017-04-20T09:14:07Z,"Mihyang’s studio apartment was wonderful! This is the smallest Airbnb my husband and I have ever done and I was worried it might be a tad small but the location was so ideal that we tried it. Honestly it was plenty of room. We were barely in the apartment as we spent all day sightseeing, but when we were it was great. The kitchen was standard and had anything you might need. The highlight for us was the washer machine! It was so easy to use and since the weather was chillier than we expected we only had 1 sweater each and we loved being able to wash it and re-wear it. The decor was very nice and made me feel like I was truly staying in a friend’s home. The windows allowed amazing light and great ventilation. We did use the air on one of the days because it was unusually warm and it worked very well. Mihyang met us with a smile even though we had been a bit delayed from our flight and briefly explained everything and let us settle in after a long day of traveling. The bathroom was comparable to what you would expect for a studio and the shower had great pressure and hot water. A welcome relief after an entire day of sightseeing. The bed was comfortable with extra pillows if needed. As other reviews mentioned, there are bars and restaurants downstairs and as expected some noise can be heard at night. Now for me, I am a heavy sleeper and it didn’t affect me at all especially after all the walking and exploring we did. But my husband is a light sleeper and he was more aware of it during the night than I was. Nothing some ear plugs can’t solve if you are like my husband. Just a minor note to mention, but I also feel like it was the same in Barcelona because most restaurants are below apartments in Spain. It certainly should not discourage you AT ALL for the great deal you get with this place. The neighborhood is nice and there are plenty of markets nearby perfect for some supplies to keep in the fridge. In terms of location we felt the apartment was in the center of everything we did.  There are a lot of great neighborhoods in Madrid, this is definitely more of a touristy one but we really liked Puerta Del Sol. She had some extra things that we ended up using like an umbrella during a rainy night and some plugs/converters. It was very helpful. Although we didn’t need much during our stay, Mihyang made sure to let us know she was available if needed. I think if you book this apartment you will be happy that you did. My husband and I hope we can return in the future! Thank you Mihyang for being a wonderful host! "
3058631,37498328,2017-04-17T09:19:59Z,"geart location, noisy at night, good value for money."

3058631,10309869,2017-04-12T07:26:19Z,"A great location if you are keen on exploring Madrid's restaurants and bars, and don't plan to get home til the wee hours. The studio is probably a great choice for a couple or friends planning to make the most of the vibrant nightlife area. For us, with kids, we found it quite noisy, as it's underneath many restaurants in a busy pedestrian street. Everything is in walking distance so location is good."

Although Sol is a very lively area especially on the weekends, so this place is best for people who are looking for exactly that! "

3058631,41581712,2017-04-07T04:38:36Z,We just returned from a 3 night stay at this lovely apartment. The location could no be more perfect. We walked to everything we saw and had a great time exploring the city. Mihyang was in constant contact leading up to our trip and arranged for us to meet her there so we could drop off our bags before check in while she was still getting ready. The apartment is sunny and spacious for 2 people. As others have said the noise can be an issue at night but having read the other reviews we were prepared for that and brought ear plugs. I am a very light sleeper but had no trouble with them in. There are wonderful tapas restaurants just outside the door and Puerto del Sol is only a couple of blocks away. It was a great place to find rest and relaxation after a long day of exploring Madrid!
3058631,79773474,2017-03-31T08:20:37Z,"A very lovely apartment, with clean utensils and colorful decoration. It's in a very convenient location and you can go any famous scenic spot on foot within 10 mins. A rather nice, beautiful accommodation in Madrid!"
3058631,81941937,2017-03-30T08:10:19Z,"Mihyang was very accomodating with our late arrival and waited for us to make sure we were comfortable in the apt. The location was convenient and central to the metro/city center. Being the center of restaurants and bars, expect some noise.  Otherwise, we loved the location.  The apt was clean and had everything that we needed. We would stay here again."
3058631,45409118,2017-03-27T06:03:44Z,Great place to stay very centrally located. Mihyang was very easy to communicate with. The Airbnb was very clean. Overall a great place to stay if you are visiting Madrid with up to one other person.
3058631,6783956,2017-03-26T07:05:42Z,"It was a very nice apartment, very located in the middle of the city center. The hosts were very kind and everything functioned perfectly. Noise-sensitive people should take ear-protection, because the flat is in a little street full of tapas-bars. anyway we slept very gold as well without earprotection. A big thank to the hosts! "
3058631,53795862,2017-03-22T03:57:44Z,Excellent. !! In a lively lane way with many great restaurants. Great location walking distance to all major attractions and shopping.  Very small very clean and well stocked kitchen etc.  There were 2 of us but we were comfortable in the space. The lift is a bonus for sure !!! We would stay again..
3058631,33455153,2017-03-19T10:08:37Z,"We stayed only one night, but had a great experience! Check-in was extremely easy, and Mihyang was very accommodating. We were initially worried that the noise from restaurants below would be excessive in the night (especially on a Saturday), but it was just fine! Very comfortable and clean. Would return for sure!"
3058631,86556059,2017-03-18T10:35:31Z,"This apartment is located in the best location possible for someone visiting Madrid. It was clean, spacious, and had everything you could ask for! Mihyang is so sweet and was always willing to answer our questions. Highly recommend!! "

724905,9288569,2017-04-24T14:21:21Z,"We have stayed at nilla's apartment for 3 nights. It is creatively and beautifully furnished - a place for relaxation and inspiration. Especially the balcony with its beautiful view over the river and the cute colored houses, lying therefore in the hammock is unique. We stayed in Bosa during the Bosa beer festival with live music, all different kind of Sardinian beers and a market full of handmade things, changed the small city in a lively and exciting place. Thank you, Nilla, for everything! "

Le seul petit bémol était la pression de la douche. Ca peut paraître dérisoire mais la pression était très faible ce qui rend le fait de se laver les cheveux assez compliqué. 

Mais Nilla est très aimable et l'appartement vraiment mignon et cosy. J'y retournerais sans hésiter !! "

Je kunt de keuken gebruiken met alle basisbenodigdheden (kruiden, olie ect) en Nilla had verse olijven, wat groente en fruit neergelegd. Ze gaf ons goede tips waar we uiteten konden. Hoewel haar engels beperkt is, was de uitleg over het appartment duidelijk (en over de app gebruikte we (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) translate). Bosa is daarnaast het mooiste stadje wat we op Sardinie gezien hebben en er is swinters ook nog wat open:). (in andere kleine dorpen weinig)"

Also the studio itself is originally decorated.
Studio is in the center of the city, you can find all necessary things in walking distance.
We definitely recommend to stay in the studio of Nilla.
Due to internet problems we could not make a fix appointment with Nilla but as a great host she did not find it a problem and came directly upon our arrival.
Nilla it was a pleasure to spent our days in your studio, hope to see you next time again."

The flat was well equipped, we would have liked some extra pillows. The terrace is wonderful, we spent an entire day lazing on it watching the world go by and fighting over the hammock, which was sheer luxury. The only problem with the place for us who are very unfit was the never ending flights of stairs, a stay is a must but ensure you start going to the gym before you arrive "

L'appartamento di Nilla e' la sistemazione perfetta per un soggiorno unico nel centro di Bosa. Dalla bella terrazza con vista sul fiume e sul paese, all'arredo anch'esso unico e curato nei minimi dettagli con pezzi recuperati e adattati con gran gusto, il design del bagno e dell'ambiente cucina/camera con particolari tutti da scoprire uno per uno, che da soli rendono il soggiorno unico.
Nilla ha evidentemente messo una cura personale nel rendere l'appartamento piacevole e esclusivo; niente a che vedere con un tipico appartamento, pur con tutti i servizi, ma piatto e privo di carattere.
Ho soggiornato da Nilla per un giorno ed una notte con mia nipote ed entrambe subito abbiamo espresso lo stesso desiderio di incontrare Nilla di persona, certi che chi ha creato questo piccolo nido in cima ad un vecchio palazzo del centro di Bosa, ha carattere, gusto e personalità degni d'essere conosciuti.
Purtroppo Nilla era fuori Bosa e non abbiamo avuto modo di conoscerci, ma l'amica Roberta ci ha accolti come se fossimo vecchi amici. Grazie ad entrambe. Ho gia' voglia di tornare a Bosa per passare qualche giorno in più in questo piccolo gioiellino; ho gia' sparso la voce fra i miei amici e certamente non posso che raccomandare a chiunque di alloggiare da Nilla per una visita unica del paese.

Nilla's apartment is the perfect place to enjoy the center of Bosa with a touch of personality and unique style.
The place is nested on top of an old building, with a beautiful little terrace overlooking the river and the town; big enough for a siesta for two or a dinner for 4 or more.
The apartment is cozy and shows a unique attention to detail; once we saw the place we immediately wanted to get to meet Nilla as her place shows an exotic taste with a local Sardinian touch, with old reclaimed objects and art pieces mindfully placed all around; everything suggesting she is a person worth knowing. The design of the bathroom and the studio room just makes you at ease so much that we wanted to stay longer. Unfortunately my niece (that was traveling with me for a few days) had to go back to school. She studies art and was fascinated (like me) by Nilla's place.
Too bad Nilla was out of town for the day and unable to meet us in person; her friend Roberta greeted us as friends and welcomed us to the place.
I will be back and have already told my friends about this little jewel alone worth a visit to Bosa. I certainly can't be more confident in recommending anyone visiting Bosa to experience Nilla's place. Nothing close to a plain (perhaps comfortable) hotel room; this is certainly comfortable but offers a unique experience.

Grazie Nilla!"

Ontdekking, verbazing en verwondering zijn in dit verband de dingen die me bijblijven. De grot in combinatie met tuin en dakterras is een oase in een drukke stad."

Raquel left us with bread, eggs, butter, jam, milk and coffee which was much appreciated as there is no supermarket close by. We walked in and out of the centre of town which was about 15-20min walk but you can easily catch a bus.
Raquel has a pet turtle that is really cute! Would stay there again! "
735784,39970328,2017-04-02T10:00:15Z,"Raquel is a lovely host! She kindly prepared eggs, bread and coffee for our breakfast and let us know where are the best places to visit. Living in the cave was a unique experience. The lighting was a little dim, but it makes sense since there's no window. It was a bit cold for us when we need to use the bathroom as it's outside the cave - but just 3 steps away so it shouldn't be a problem for most people / when it's warmer. Note that there is no signal / reception / wifi in the cave!"
735784,3897514,2017-03-26T07:52:13Z,"Raquel's adorable cave with an amazing terrace looking at Alhambra will be an unforgettable experience for anyone! I think it provides a much richer experience than staying at a hotel in the city centre. There was of course no plumbing in the cave and the bathroom is outside just next to the door. We had a nice 'back to basics' feeling.  Raquel was very helpful too, she showed us around, pointed out the prettiest routes to the centre and even arranged us a visit to the Flamenco show in one of the caves. 2 tips for future visitors: it tends to get chilly in the cave and it can be difficult to walk on the slippery cobblestone streets, so bring proper shoes. Thanks a lot for everything Raquel!"
735784,117436179,2017-03-21T09:39:47Z,"For mobile guests without handicaps.  Superb location away from the crowds.  Brilliant terrace. Warm, people friendly host.  Remarkable accomodation and groovy lighting.  Thanks for a great stay Raquel. Un beso Emma"
735784,3020803,2017-03-15T08:45:33Z,"La cueva de Raquel es un lugar muy especial y perfecto para empaparse del ambiente del Sacromonte, uno de los barrios más emblemáticos e interesantes de Granada. Es amplio y cómodo, e ideal como punto de partida para descubrir la ciudad (hay parada de bus a 1 minuto de la casa) o para sumergirse en el ambiente flamenco del barrio. También es ideal para conversaciones y lecturas en total tranquilidad. El baño está fuera de la cueva y es un poco pequeño, pero tiene encanto. Eso sí, cuidado si llueve porque el suelo resbala :-)

Por otro lado, hubieron algunos detalles que no nos gustaron y que, de mejorarse, hubieran supuesto una estancia perfecta. En primer lugar, fue muy complicado llegar porque una de las indicaciones que nos dieron era incorrecta y ello desembocó en un lío enorme para poder alcanzar el Sacromonte en coche - acabamos en dirección prohibida, a gente insultándonos, etc-. Los GPS's se vuelven locos en Granada y hubiéramos agradecido unas indicaciones más precisas. 

En segundo lugar, cuando alquilo una casa completa busco privacidad, y en este caso no ha le encontrado. Como no hay agua en la propia cueva, Raquel se ofrece a recoger la cubertería sucia -ya que vive justo al lado-, lo que a priori es un detalle por su parte, ya que nosotros estaríamos encantados de recoger y limpiar todo. Sin embargo, para nuestra sorpresa, encontramos a nuestra llegada que también había apagado la calefacción. Y así todos los días. Hemos estado a 3º y dos de los cuatro días lloviendo, con temporal. Nos comentó que apagáramos la calefacción al marcharnos por la mañana y le propuse bajarla al mínimo. La noche anterior, al llegar, tuvimos frío y quería evitarlo de nuevo. Su respuesta nos incomodó: se enfadó y abandonó la casa murmurando que le venían facturas elevadísimas, etc. Evidentemente, con ese ""mal rollo"" nos preocupábamos de dejar todo bien apagado al irnos por la mañana. Esa sensación de sentirse vigilado fue muy incómoda.

Comprendo que hay mucho huésped irresponsable que tiene el aire acondicionado o la calefacción ""a tope"", pero no era nuestro caso. Y aun si lo fuera, se pueden pedir y hablar las cosas con amabilidad: esto no es una ONG, sino una vivienda por cuyo alojamiento se cobra (y no poco), y ello incluye una serie de servicios que todo propietario ha de asumir.

En tercer y último lugar, me decidí por esta casa por las magníficas opiniones y valoraciones que leí, muchas de ellas haciendo hincapié en la amabilidad, generosidad y consejos de Raquel. A nosotros no nos dio apenas información...

En suma, quiero pensar que simplemente Raquel no tenía unos días buenos, o que estaba agobiada / cansada porque acababa de llegar de un largo viaje. Estoy seguro de que en otro momento la experiencia con ella hubiera sido magnífica, tanto como lo es su casa. "
735784,97015989,2017-03-09T08:54:37Z,"Nice hideaway in the hills of Granada. Raquel was a great host and helped us with details on where to go, flamenco night and even had coffee and eggs for our breakfast!"
735784,68981959,2017-02-06T10:59:58Z,这是一次很特别的住宿体验 很有趣 虽然是冬天 但是 屋子里面很暖和 Raqule很热情 为我们准备了早餐的食材 每天都来问候 
735784,8901913,2017-02-04T07:32:42Z,What a unique and memorable experience! We absolutely loved staying in the cave and watching the sunset from the neighbourhood benches and the rooftop terrace. It was a privilege to stay in Raquel's Cave. 
735784,45342142,2017-01-30T09:11:41Z,"La cueva de Raquel es un lugar especial, el lugar ideal para vivir una gran experiencia en Granada.  Un lugar romántico para las parejas y donde disfrutaran también los más pequeños. Sin duda muy recomenda.ble"
735784,4897966,2017-01-26T07:56:52Z,"La cueva de Raquel es fantástica! Fue una experiencia única y seguro que nos quedaremos de nuevo aquí si volvemos a Granada. Si vienen en enero es frío pero Raquel tiene radiadores y bastantes cobijas que hacen la experiencia muy acogedora :) 
Muchas gracias Raquel por tan linda experiencia! "
735784,8289615,2017-01-22T10:14:41Z,Probablemente sea éste el lugar en el que tener una experiencia más única en Granada. 100% recomendable; Raquel es muy hospitalaria y la cueva es muy acogedora.
735784,32569758,2017-01-09T09:10:57Z,"Raquel fue muy amable indicándonos como llegar, ya que llegamos un poco tarde, estaba todo limpio y los lo dejo apunto para nuestra llegada. El alojamiento es muy acogedor, algo diferente a lo que estamos acostumbrados y esta cerca de los lugares de interés, fuimos andando a todas partes."
735784,12209864,2017-01-01T10:51:54Z,"We loved our stay at the cave! The description was completely accurate: great location, CLEAN, and perfectly equipped! Raquel is the perfect hostess: she met us when we arrived to show us to the cave (so easy) and walked us through where everything was. She's so warm and friendly, we thought we were staying with family. She connected us with a discount for flamenco at the Venta De Gallo and a bus pass.

The location in Sacramonte is AMAZING...the view of the caves and the Alhambra are perfect. It's a 10-20 minute walk to everywhere. 

She supplied us with eggs, bread, butter, milk, coffee, sugar, jam, olive oil and salt: such a wonderful convenience for making our first breakfast!  She washed our dishes for us and tidied up each day too..such a treat. 

The in-courtyard bathroom worked out fine (a bit chilly in the winter, but the slippers provided were a great touch). Plenty of towels and hair dryer provided. 

The heaters kept the cave toasty and the dehumidifier worked great to get the dampness out of the air. I bought some incense to burn in the cave too: another excuse for shopping in the Albaizin. 

Sleeping in the cave was just that: dark and (URL HIDDEN) easy to relax! 

We had a wonderful time and felt like locals by the end of our stay. Highly recommended!!!! "
735784,101841567,2016-12-26T07:56:02Z,Excellent location!  Beautiful and unique experience! Gracious hostess!  
735784,92292730,2016-12-11T08:36:27Z,Raquel nos recibió con mucha alegria y la casa era preciosa. No pasamos frío aunque estamos en diciembre. El barrio es de cuento igual que la casa de Raquel. Muy buena experiencia
735784,18959427,2016-12-06T08:34:36Z,Un sitio unico con unas vistas excepcionales. Imposible llevarse mal recuerdo!
50724,104817331,2017-05-08T01:29:29Z,Very special place with a great host to boot. Everything was amazing!
50724,16955911,2017-04-30T21:45:28Z,My wife and I had a great time staying in the treehouse for a couple of nights during over honeymoon...like nothing else we've ever done before! Gail was a great host and we felt very welcome there. Tia was also fantastic and was flexible with us during check in!
50724,100012096,2017-04-23T19:22:22Z,"This treehouse is amazing! Very clean, well kept, and full of lovely details. Communication was great and instructions were sent beforehand as well as printed in a binder when we arrived. VERY highly recommend this location."
50724,20271561,2017-04-21T18:14:45Z,"There are places you stay just to have a home base while you go explore... and then there are places like this treehouse. For us, it was a destination unto itself. If you told me that we had to hike 20 miles uphill to get there, I would do it in a heartbeat. There is nothing like a private jungle paradise all to yourself - nothing compares. We highly recommend booking enough time to have a chill day just alternating between the hot tub, the shower, and the upper/lower lanais for bird watching and utter relaxation. You will not regret it. Mahalo Tia and Gail!

Try to fly into Hilo if you can, or be prepared for the 2.5 hr drive from KOA - beware if you drive through the middle of the island (the fastest route) there are no places to stop and eat. "
50724,114064888,2017-04-11T18:55:38Z,We ran out of power early plan on roughing it.  Also clean kitchen before using.   Mouse droppings!
50724,369459,2017-04-01T19:51:01Z,"We loved our time at the treehouse! It was very quiet and secluded, and a great place to relax. We loved the hot tub and the delicious treats left for us the first day. The service was wonderful, and we had a great time. Do consider that the sound of rain falling on a metal roof can be VERY loud, so bringing earplugs to sleep in might be prudent if you are a light sleeper (because it rains a LOT!)! Otherwise, our stay was perfect!"
50724,89660770,2017-03-30T21:23:27Z,This is a good place for people who want to get away the city life. Really nice tree house and specially the hot tube makes your day worth it if you don't want to go anywhere 
50724,23706885,2017-03-29T19:44:49Z,"My husband and I loved our stay at the treehouse!  With the hot tub, mini kitchen, birds to watch at the feeder, books, and television with movies, we could've spent our entire vacation inside the house and never gotten bored!  The space is SO beautiful and enchanting you will never want to leave.  "
50724,68523313,2017-03-24T21:49:08Z,"This place is beyond description!  Expensive - yes, but the experience is phenomenal: sitting in a hot tub in the trees as the sun rises, listening to the rain drip off of all the leaves in the forest around you, looking down on tree ferns standing over twenty feet tall, admiring the attention to detail in the treehouse - gorgeous stained glass windows, hand carved doors, truly unique architecture, an outdoor shower in the trees, wonderful breakfast fixings - fruit, yogurt, homemade bread, local coffee. 

Tia, who takes care of the place, was incredible.  She met us, showed us around and stressed she was available 24/7.  Unfortunately, we did have to call her at 7am (sorry, Tia) because the pilot light on the water heater went out, and while an outdoor shower is fun, not so much with cold water.  She was at the house within 10 minutes, fixed the problem and we were back in the heat.  Climbing the stairs (essentially a ladder) to the  bedroom was not something you would want to do after drinking a little too much wine  Make sure to read the details about paying the lodging tax to the owner outside of AirBnB.  This surprised me, because all other rentals we have done with these guys must roll the tax into the base rental fee.

Although, we only stayed one night, we definitely recommend this house for a very memorable visit."
50724,15065561,2017-03-23T18:58:06Z,"Everything about the treehouse is fantastic, especially if you're looking to spend time at the park. Hot tub is great for relaxing after long days hiking in the sun. Highly recommended."
50724,57775148,2017-03-13T04:38:35Z,"Super Service, tolles Ambiente und leckeres Frühstück :)"
50724,105691904,2017-03-10T19:46:26Z,The tree house was just as beautiful in person! And Gail went above and beyond for us during our stay. Thank you for allowing us to experience your unique sanctuary!
50724,16111480,2017-03-06T20:24:59Z,"My husband and I loved our stay at the tree house. The area is so cozy and well decorated. The stain glass panels are beautiful, the outdoor shower is extremely relaxing and the hot tub added the perfect touch to a long day exploring Volcano National Park. The tree house is such a peaceful place to stay and waking up to a symphony of birds among the trees is indescribable. The tree house is a magical place to stay, and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very special experience in Volcano. "
50724,100110097,2017-02-04T19:52:26Z,"What an amazing place! If you're planning on exploring Volcano national park, this place is perfect for coming back to and relaxing. It is in a secluded area in a quiet neighborhood and is about a ~15 minute drive to Volcano national park and about a ~30 minute drive to Hilo. Gale is friendly and knowledgeable about the area. We had a small problem with hot water, and she had somebody over and fixed within 10 minutes of texting her. Couldn't say enough great things about the treehouse. Highly recommended. "
50724,81379346,2017-02-03T19:41:06Z,This stay was definitely a highlight of our trip. We were unfortunately not able to meet our host but the arrival into the place was something magical!!! We made some nice heathly breakfasts which was delicious and the atmosphere in the treehouse was all round amazing. This is an unforgettable memory to make!
50724,52044504,2017-02-01T18:06:39Z,Everthing was PERFECT! It is very unique and cozy. Gail and Tia have been very nice and helpful. We enjoyed our stay there and truly appreciated it!!
50724,60633318,2017-01-31T02:02:35Z,Tia was great. Place was awesome and just as described. Highly recommend!
50724,761289,2017-01-26T18:23:13Z,"Staying at the treehouse is an unforgettable experience! We were warmly welcomed and shown around, and found everything as promised. It's truly magic to wake up surrounded by rainforest, and to see the starts from the bed at night. Close to the Volcano national park too!"
50724,22690948,2017-01-24T20:43:59Z,"The treehouse is a magical experience. Everything was perfect from later then expected check in, the hot tub in the rain and the fresh breakfast. Would come back to volcano treehouse in a heartbeat! Thank you Gail, Robert and Tia."
50724,10296170,2017-01-20T21:20:58Z,"Lovely hot tub, cozy double bed, sweet living room and kitchenette. Close to beautiful volcano national park-- right off the main highway. Tia, the caretaker, was lovely. "
3983914,2818449,2017-04-29T10:09:16Z,An amazing historic stay. In a perfect spot. Only problem is too many people want to stay here.
3983914,35112279,2017-04-15T07:56:34Z,"С Бекой не встречались, но он всегда оперативно отвечал на сообщения и просьбы, рядом была хозяйка Мари. Кроме того, Бека прислал за нами недорогое такси и в день отъезда мы уехали значительно позже назначенного времени, за что ему большое спасибо!) В лофте приятно и уютно, за окном вполне тихо, спать никто не мешал. А вот видимость нас с улицы и окон напротив немного смущала. Важное замечание: мы были с двумя детьми (1,5 года и 5 лет), в помещении низкие окна и ставни никак не защищены, легко открываются, мы частенько ловили детей, вылезающих в окно. В итоге мы просто закрыли глухие ставни и обходились меньшим светом. В квартире нет плиты, только микроволновка, тоже важно, если планируете детское меню. Но нам это не сильно мешало. Еще коляска в дверь входит только в сложенном виде (ширина <60см). И еще один момент: кровати меньше 2м в длину (кому актуально)! В целом у нас остались приятные впечатления от места)"
3983914,70233847,2017-04-08T07:55:41Z,"Beka is a great communicator and his apartment is clean, comfortable and in a very nice area!"
3983914,351792,2017-04-01T04:47:02Z,Прекрасная квартира - очень милая и тёплая. Хорошее расположение - до всего рукой подать) обязательно вернёмся! 
3983914,82447706,2017-03-26T05:40:45Z,Good place in the centre.
3983914,41725991,2017-03-19T05:05:24Z,"If you wanna a fascinating experiences in Tbilisi, then Beka's house is definitely your choice! It's just located in the very center of the city and one of the busiest main street is behind his house. Also, many sites are within walking distance. When you open the blue door of his house, you will scream as Wow because inside it's really beautiful, exactly the same as shown on the pics, and you can find everything inside, it's just like your sweet home! Although we didn't meet Beka himself, he arranged everything like he asked the housekeeper to pick us up at the airport, teach us how to open the door, and he had wrote some notes for the travelers for recommendation for food, leisure everything in Tbilisi at his house. Wanna say thanks again to Beka and we will choose here a second time if we will be in Tbilisi again:) Just don't miss this house!!"
3983914,9935909,2017-03-05T04:03:31Z,"Квартира чудесна! Хорошо расположена, на очень красивой улице, все необходимое рядом. 
Века отличный хозяин, оперативно отвечал на все вопросы и очень нам во всем помогал. Спасибо за тёплый приём!"
3983914,24412497,2017-02-23T07:36:59Z,"Very nice, cosy, well located loft in trendy area. Perfect for one or two people, or a small family. "
3983914,106280861,2017-02-18T06:45:54Z,"Настоящий лофт в уникальном по архитектурному стилю и красоте здании. Лофт в центре города, рядом с Сухим мостом, на пешеходной части проспекта Агмешабели. Всё в пешей доступности или на такси за 2$. Фотографии соответствуют реальности. Бека, спасибо! "
3983914,35631379,2017-02-13T05:05:52Z,"This is a lovely apartment in an easily accessible neighbourhood. Beka was very helpful and available for communication, and the recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants provided with the apartment were really excellent. We were very happy here and would happily stay again – thank you! "

По близости есть красивая пешеходная улица, где можно найти много винных баров и ресторанов. Блошиный рынок на Сухом мосту также в пешей доступности. Все очень понравилось!"
3983914,24412497,2017-01-27T07:14:01Z,Great communicator. Nice and clean loft in newly renovated area. Highly recommended.

3983914,1275846,2016-12-27T01:17:35Z,"We had a great stay in Beka's flat.
An amazing building, a huge cozy room and everything you need.
Our children loved the space for playing after visiting the city.
A very nice road without traffic and nice coffee shops and pups just around the corner. 
We liked the Velo coffeeshop very much.
We had a great stay and would love to come back.
Thank you!"
3983914,6540955,2016-12-15T05:09:16Z,"Очень атмосферная квартира! Всё как на фотографиях. Удобное месторасположение ,рядом улица с новыми барами и сухой мост. Единственное, дом старый и присутствует запах ,от этого уже не избавиться. Квартира чистая ,есть всё необходимое. Очень весело провели в ней время с музыкой на подоконниках ;)в восторге от Грузии!"
3983914,74396676,2016-12-05T06:32:23Z,"Если хотите ощутить атмосферу Тбилиси - однозначно советую этот лофт! В старом доме, на 1 этаже, с совершенно уникальной атмосферой! До Старого города минут 15-20 пешком. Совсем рядом - Сухой мост и блошиный рынок. 
Очень приятный хозяин. Позволил оставить вещи в день выезда после 12.00, так как у нас самолет был вечером!
Рекомендую!"
3983914,31597967,2016-11-22T04:55:44Z,"Очень атомосферная квартира. Было ощущение, что живем в музее. Стиль выдержан до мелочей. Надеемся, что вернемся"
3983914,3253469,2016-11-16T05:05:25Z,"Всё красиво и удобно! Расположение - реально лучшее, жили ещё в двух районах Тбилиси, но этот самый привлекательный! В лофте есть все необходимое, вокруг - кафе рестораны, магазины и аптеки, обменники и прочее. Стоянка такси прямо у дома. 
Крайне рекомендуем!"

5694880,32357566,2017-04-23T10:38:00Z,"I traveled alone to Havana and Casa Blanca Malecon 413 was all I expected. The house is tastefully decorated. My room (above the living area) offered views of Malecon and sunsets. The room was basic but clean and the bathroom was adequate. The air-conditioner worked too well, I had to lower it one night. Breakfast every morning was lovely and plentiful at CUC4. One night, they made a sunset cocktail, Cuba Libre which was strong and refreshing. I drank it on the balcony. Casa Blanca is in an ideal location, about 20 minute walk from the sites and Havana Vieja. WiFi can be found at the Hotel Deauville about 3 blocks away. Great location and great people at Casa Blanca. Perfect for the solo female traveler.  For a more detailed review, visit my blog at (URL HIDDEN)"
5694880,27364999,2017-04-19T15:58:30Z,The bnb is right on the sea which is wonderful. Lots of activity on the road in front and if you buy a wifi card you can access in front. Lovely breakfasts and the place is very clean. Nice restaurant up the road called Casa Miglis. Lovely people to welcome you and make you feel at home. Great stay and introduction to Havana.
5694880,33498890,2017-04-17T12:48:56Z,"it's a good choice for a stay in Havana, about 1/2 way between Old Havana and (URL HIDDEN) either case you are looking at a 15-20 min walk, or a $ 5.00 cab ride"
5694880,49641797,2017-04-16T15:58:00Z,Sehr nette und bemühte Gastgeber  Wohnung geschmackvoll eingerichtet aber leider viel zu laut da direkt am Malecon. Am letzten unserer 4 Tage dann leider auch kein Wasser mehr.
5694880,17109629,2017-04-13T03:44:12Z,Se oye mucho el ruido de coches en la habitación.El desayuno no está incluido en el precio.Hay bichos tipo termita en la zona alta de la pared
5694880,80659282,2017-04-06T13:51:47Z,"What a perfect location! Right on the esplanade. Our room and common room overlooked the water. Close to the old town where all the live music and restaurants are. The common area was beautiful with traditional furniture and the hosts were very friendly and helpful. Room was nice, had ensuite and fridge. We loved our stay, we would definitely recommend it to everyone."
5694880,71849927,2017-04-04T14:55:50Z,"Fue perfecta para lo que necesitábamos, la ubicación nos encantó...el personal te ayuda y resuelve dudas, la limpieza que es muy importante para mí, estuvo excelente!.

Si volvemos a Cuba, feliz me volvería a quedar en la Casa Blanca!."
5694880,26245161,2017-03-26T15:36:15Z,"A beautiful home with fantastic views of the Malecon, we were sad to only stay one night. Yosvany arranged our transfer from the airport which was really easy, breakfast was good and reasonably priced, room comfy and shower hot! We'll definitely book again if we return to Havana (when we return!) Thank you!"
5694880,118166268,2017-03-23T14:15:16Z,"Hotel-like feel, but very welcoming.  Beautiful views right out the shared-space living room.  Breakfast was delicious.  A little tough to find the entrance.  At the time of writing this post, they were doing work on the building, but the place you are looking for is right next to the restaurant.  Enter through the front door, and the main entrance is on the second flight (door to the right).  We arrived early, but we knocked and our host met us and got us checked in no problem.  And gave us fresh, icy lemonade!  Highly recommend. A++"
5694880,118145986,2017-03-22T14:21:33Z,"Très joli logement décoré avec beaucoup de goût. Accueil très sympa , petit déjeuner parfait

J ai beaucoup aimé ce logement et l accueil charmant
"
5694880,38951479,2017-03-17T14:51:14Z,"The highlight of our stay (just one night) was the staff, who were all lovely. This was our least casa-like experience by far — it felt more like a B&B — but we were very well cared for. The space is beautiful, the views are amazing, the bathroom is huge and the space really is as charmingly all-white as the pictures show. We had a great time! A little bit of noise, which is to be expected, and no glass in the window, which is pretty typical but smelled a bit like gasoline so near the major road. Would visit again!"
5694880,88084916,2017-03-16T14:30:46Z,"We liked it. The room was clean, the service was very good, people were very helpful."

Si querés tener la experiencia de ir a La Habana a una casa (y no hotel), no dudes en ir a lo de Yosvany. La gente que trabaja allí es muy servicial, amorosa, se preocupa por todos los detalles y por hacerte sentir bien y cómodo... Nos ayudaron con los taxis, los traslados, se preocuparon por que todo salga bien, averiguar vuelos, etc... Todo genial: la casa, la limpieza, el desayuno, las charlas con Maite y Reinaldo... si volvemos a La Habana, volvemos a lo de Yosvany sin dudarlo!"
5694880,104709556,2017-03-12T12:57:33Z,Cannot recommend this place enough!
5694880,27559780,2017-03-10T14:30:09Z,Very clean!!! it always smelled so great and breakfast was great as well. top notch service and right in front of el Malecón. Host were very accommodating and very kind. 
5694880,109250567,2017-03-07T14:10:01Z,"Beautifully decorated home, great guest room, and the balcony was the perfect place to relax. Everyone was so friendly, and always smiling. Suggest you purchase breakfast at this casa particular, as it was lovely.  Overall,  great hospitality!  "
5694880,29604072,2017-03-07T08:56:44Z,"Casa Blanca es un sueño frente al Malecón, las fotos no decepcionan y toda la gente de la casa es atenta y amorosa. Esta muy bien ubicada para conocer varios destinos a pie. La recomendamos %100"
5694880,2271921,2017-03-03T13:39:26Z,"La casa Blanca è un sogno, proprio come appare in foto. Un ambiente di un'eleganza senza tempo. Essere lì con mia moglie e la nostra piccola ci ha fatto sentire privilegiati. La camera è piccolina ma dotata di tutti i confort. Dal Malecon arriva una piacevole brezza marina e ogni tanto qualche schiamazzo, ma fa parte del fascino del posto. Buona la colazione. Gentili e simpatici i padroni di casa. Yosvany l'ho visto solo per poco, ma è stato puntualissimo e cortese nella comunicazione. CI ha anche organizzato il transfer dall'aeroporto, su mia richiesta. La vista dalla camera da pranzo è magnifica. Ricorderò per sempre mia figlia che spegne qui la sua prima candelina. La posizione l'ho trovata perfetta. Appena fuori dalla Habana Vieja che abbiamo sempre raggiunto a piedi con una piacevole passeggiata di 15' circa, cambiando spesso il tragitto per vedere le diverse strade. A pochi passi anche un paio di ottimi ristoranti, soprattutto il Castropol, proseguendo a dx lungo il Malecon. Dal lato opposto a circa un km si raggiunge il Callejon de Hamel, la zona degli artisti che consiglio di non perdere (anche se è ormai diventata turistica). Non so quando tornerò a l'habana, ma se ci torno, sarà ancora qui.  "
5694880,40244472,2017-02-24T15:05:47Z,"Yosvany's place is a gorgeous find on the Malecon.  It is beautifully decorated all in pure white with a sea breeze and terrific views.  His gracious sister/cousins are very helpful and set up a wonderful breakfast. You long to linger with the crashing waves and view but Havana awaits!  Yosvany stopped by to meet us and make sure all was well.   There are many good restaurants nearby -- try Casta et Tat, reasonable and yummy.  We stopped here after a stay in the center of Havana Viejo, which is more convenient for museums and central squares, churches but lacks the majesty of the Malecon.  Other guests we met were lovely Brits off on adventures cycling.  There are stairs but they help you with the luggage so no worries.  Highly recommend!"

394575,59308548,2017-05-02T21:30:22Z,My wife and I loved this place. The very first day we walked up Bernal Hills and got a spectacular view of the city. The room was clean and I especially loved the bookshelf with all the books that they have collected over the years! They even have some home-made jam and nuts available for us. My wife loved the authentic wooden flooring and the neighborhood we were in. Will definitely make a trip here again!
394575,7199913,2017-04-29T21:13:59Z,"Unique space, very comfy and enjoyed spending time there!"
394575,61012448,2017-04-24T16:27:22Z,Absolutely loved staying here for my first trip to San Francisco. 
394575,8014803,2017-04-16T17:48:40Z,"This listing is exactly as described.  Great for a couple looking to get the feel of living in San Francisco, you really feel like a local. Being active is helpful because there is a lot of uphill walking everywhere in San Francisco! We loved every minute!"
394575,325227,2017-04-10T05:54:31Z,"Great location, lots of parking (a big plus in SF) very quiet at night, can get to anywhere in the city in reasonable time.  If you are planning to cook a lot, it's a bit of a challenge but for snacks and breakfast is fine.  All in all a good experience."
394575,11475277,2017-03-24T18:52:09Z,"Superb location! Easy parking, access to public transport and food/supermarkets. Mike and Nic were super accommodating and polite too :)"
394575,117923819,2017-03-20T15:46:26Z,"Very nice neighborhood, parking is kind of a challenge but overall very nice and quiet good central location and private."
394575,119986241,2017-03-17T15:13:43Z,"This was my first time using Airbnb and my experience was absolutely amazing. Mike and Nic were super helpful, kind and responsive, which was very important to me. 
We arrived earlier than expected and Mike was willing to open the door early for us. Once inside, I was blown away by how beautiful the place looked and how accurate the photos were. 
The best part about the 2-day stay was being able to walk outside the apartment and see the sunrise and set from the hilltop. There are stairs that lead up to a very popular hiking area, the view was amazing and the people were super friendly. 
When I go back, i'm looking to stay at Mike and Nic's place, and you should too!
Thanks guys!"
394575,115968354,2017-03-15T15:08:13Z,This was our first time using airbnb. We enjoyed our stay!
394575,92653394,2017-03-09T19:43:19Z,"I loved the set up of the space-was really nice to come ""home"" to.. my studio space was like this so it's nice feel at home I almoSt didn't want to leave. The area is over a hill so you get to see view of the city and a short hike away lets you see more of the city. The room had a mix of Island feel/1920s/bohemian eclectic mix of things but all were useful and purposeful. It is on pricey side but worth it for second honeymoon or a treat if you can afford. The street is on a steep hill so know how to park and turn your wheels. Mike is really nice and met us around our schedules. It is quiet area, although my friends mentioned they were jamming a bit loud one night.. I was sleeping early, and didn't notice. All in all not bad. It was good experience. Would've been great experience if my friends had paid their full share of the space.. ended up costing me more than I planned for SF trip as I would not have gotten this if they didn't need a place as well. Had to cancel a place that would only cost me $111 for 5 nights instead of this $678 (551 plus the other cancel fee 24, plus $103 for another night at another place as this isn't available) for 4 nights. "
394575,31829656,2017-03-07T19:20:39Z,Fantabulous! Highly recommended.
394575,25863578,2017-03-05T17:06:19Z,We loved our stay at Mike and Nic's place. You can get about anywhere in the City using the 24 or 67 Muni busses--both of which have stops within 2 blocks of the home. 
394575,10968169,2017-03-01T17:14:53Z,"Great communication. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. The views are the neighborhood were breathtaking. The place was very large and everything worked great-- shower, water boiler, fridge. The bed was comfy. And I am very very satisfied with this stay!"
394575,22494630,2017-02-27T18:08:48Z,My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at Mike and Nic's place. It is super cozy! Good location--we were able to take an Uber pretty much anywhere we wanted to go for about $6-$10. Mike and Nic were quick to respond if we needed anything. We would stay here again!
394575,59185793,2017-02-24T19:42:59Z,"I couldn't have wished for a more perfect place to stay. Mike met me on arrival which is always a bonus when you've travelled so far. The apartment was light and spacious and homely, I really didn't want to leave. Could have happily moved in permanently! It's a fabulous, picturesque and safe neighbourhood and I can't recommend it highly enough"
394575,25389038,2017-02-20T19:48:11Z,The place was amazing and the location was also super convenient! Would totally come back another time. 
394575,110157740,2017-02-17T16:35:56Z,"This place was amazing!
The hosts:
- Communication was always very prompt
- Very thoughtful, making sure that we had ample supplies, from cleaning materials, to toiletries, to condiments for cooking, they even left us treats for when we arrived!
- Respected our privacy and made sure they let us know of any activities that might be disruptive (but weren't at all!)
- Very tolerant of our boisterous toddler :)

The location:
- Just what we were looking for - endearing neighborhood with all the quaint shops and eateries, quiet and family-friendly, lots of dogs and babies strolling around  Cortland Ave. which was a short walk downhill from the residence.
- Close enough to all the interesting places that SF has to offer, very accessible. We felt like we got so much done in a day because we were so close to everything
- Parking was a breeze 99% of the time
- Felt very safe walking around at night

The space:
- The space was so full of character! The moment you step in, you feel like you've travelled back in time
- The ""bedroom"" was partitioned with a curtain and the bed was big enough for 2 adults and a toddler
- The fireplace, antique fixtures, even the creaky floors add to the charm of the studio
- The bathroom came with a lovely heating lamp, which was very welcome during the chilly mornings of our stay.
- Very vast collection of books and magazines/guides for places to visit in SF

Overall, fantastic, 5 stars, I'd give more stars if I could :)

394575,111235072,2017-01-28T18:38:22Z,Cozy and comfort
136891,21442389,2017-05-05T07:52:18Z,Perfecte plek. We zijn hier een week geweest en het is de ideale uitvalsbasis om Umbrië of een deel van Toscane te verkennen. Het torentje is heerlijk afgezonderd met een prachtig uitzicht over het meer. De ontvangst en communicatie waren prima. 
136891,108475168,2017-04-27T07:46:16Z,"Beautiful, peaceful setting with a minute drive to the lake. The accommodations very comfortable and quaint!  Highly recommend but you must have a car. Easy access on/off highway to major area sights w/in hr drive. "
136891,1879171,2017-04-24T07:30:30Z,"Amazing place, beautiful surroundings. The tower has be beautifully decorated and comfortable to stay in. "
136891,84565827,2017-04-21T08:40:15Z,"This place was really beautiful!!!!! Easy check in, secluded and romantic! Very unique place to stay, clean, functional! I would absolutely stay here again! Best views of the lake and land!!!! They had prosecco waiting for us and it was wonderful! The cats around the place were a treat! Great food and Cortona is close but you would need a car. Fun wineries and olive oil around the lake! Thanks so much for the stay we hope to be back!!!"
136891,103380461,2017-04-19T07:45:37Z,Scenic place to stay - within driving distance to tourist areas.
136891,9109719,2017-04-16T08:42:00Z,"Siamo stati nella torretta di Michele per Pasqua. L'accoglienza della signora Anna è stata ottima. Ci ha offerto persino spumante e ovetti di cioccolato :-). 
Il soggiorno è stato molto piacevole, nella tranquillità in mezzo al verde. Di mattina ci si sveglia col canto degli uccellini. Dalla camera da letto si può ammirare un panorama bellissimo con il lago Trasimeno protagonista. Fuori c'è un magnifico giardino con poltroncine per un po' di relax. Dal vicinato arrivano a salutare anche due splendidi gatti: uno a pelo lungo, l'altro rosso a pelo corto, entrambi molto affettuosi e amichevoli.
L'alloggio è dotato di tutti i comfort; ci siamo trovati davvero molto bene.
"
136891,4220419,2017-04-11T08:36:19Z,We had a wonderful stay at the Michele's Tower. The view was amazing - we really enjoyed sitting on the private terrace with a wine looking out at the lake. The tower itself is really nice and cozy. One of a kind! If you have mobility issues/ lots of luggage it can be a challenge but worth it for the experience. 
136891,34400373,2017-04-09T07:05:44Z,"The tower is an amazing place to stay and almost a tourist attraction of its own. It has a beautiful view of Lake Trasimeno and an unbeatable location to relax, get away from city life. The tower was clean and very comfortable and perfect for two people. Michele was also easy to communicate with and met us on time when we arrived. They even had a bottle of champagne waiting for us upon arrival. Overall a great place to stay. The only drawback of this location is that it's maybe a little too secluded and we found it a little tough to find places to eat dinner nearby. Other than that though, it was fantastic."
136891,120564103,2017-04-07T08:36:32Z,"Posto e appartamento bellissimi, immerso nel verde, appartamento fornito di tutto, l'unica pecca il bagno un po scomodo ma per il resto tutto perfetto."
136891,50642747,2017-04-02T08:18:10Z,"Posto incantevole. 
Perfetto per distrarsi dalla vita frenetica di tutti i giorni.
Un'oasi di pace.
I strongly recommend this fairy-tale place!"
136891,12874771,2017-03-29T09:32:03Z,Great place!
136891,18821824,2017-03-27T08:46:04Z,"The tower was very romantic, set in such a beautiful place, and surrounded by a gorgeous landscape. A great place to stay."
136891,7415765,2017-03-20T08:46:26Z,"Torre magnifica, finemente ristrutturata. Si trova in una bellissima zona con vista panoramica stupenda. Luogo appartato e romantico.
All'interno attrezzata per colazione e per cucinare. Tutto pulitissimo e curato.
Il check-inè stato preciso e flessibile così come il check out. Michele è sempre stato disponibile e pronto a rispondere alle domande in qualsiasi momento.
Raccomandatissimo!
Highly recommended!"
136891,7462933,2017-03-15T09:39:26Z,"Such a unique place to stay! My girlfriend and I had a great time here and would highly recommend it to those seeking a nice few days away. Local restaurants are great too!

You will need a car to get here and make the most of the region."
136891,46101026,2017-03-08T07:30:02Z,Charming with a great view! :)
136891,117438117,2017-02-26T07:32:31Z,Posto incantevole con una sua magia. Solo per veri romantici. Prego di non rovinare questo luogo.
136891,105605283,2017-02-10T09:52:41Z,"The Tower is in a secluded place, so make sure you have your own car. The place is well maintained, clean and beautiful. The hosts were very nice and helped us choose spots around the tower to go visit. The tower is totally worth it. "
136891,25733384,2017-01-15T10:41:11Z,Unico.
136891,2357512,2017-01-08T07:31:56Z,"Small, cosy, and well appointed (very comfortable bed): everything you need for a romantic get away. Secluded and idyllic. Beautiful lake view and highly accessible by car to local restaurants, wineries (email ahead in the off season), and sights. 
Michelle was responsive and accommodating. Communication was accurate and helpful. "

2736358,94596025,2017-05-13T15:05:07Z,Sara's Garden Retreat was a very cozy and clean place to take it easy after a day of exploring the city. The location was perfect and within walking distance of many great places.
2736358,66842299,2017-05-09T15:27:26Z,"Very convenient location. Walking distance to bars, restaurants and the Gold Gate Park. Sara is a nice, great and helpful host. We enjoyed our time there very much!!"
2736358,94677769,2017-05-05T16:51:25Z,Sehr nette Unterkunft mit zauberhaften Gartenblick. Die Lage ist sehr Zentral und eine Hop on Hop off Haltestelle in der Nähe. Sara ist eine gute Gastgeberin. 
2736358,68397283,2017-04-25T20:07:42Z,"This was a very pleasant switch from our usual choice of a Union Square hotel when we visit SF. Close to the park and only a block away from Haight St. shops and restaurants. Two bonuses: a sweet little garden and blissful quiet at night. I slept more soundly and later than I do at home. Stayed local and used Sara's recommendations for dinner both nights: Zazies (French) and Bambino's (Italian), both walkable or a $6 Uber ride. "
2736358,78725452,2017-04-20T02:59:44Z,Lovely cosy basement with fireplace in a beautiful home. Sara was quick with communication and very informative. The area has some stunning houses and Haight St is definitely interesting! It was comfortable for our five days in San Fran.
2736358,36576463,2017-04-14T15:38:32Z,We thoroughly enjoyed our (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication with Sara was easy. The neighborhood is fun and central. We would definitely stay here again!
2736358,99154307,2017-04-11T16:34:26Z,"This is a great spot ,a comfy retreat after a day exploring San Francisco. Sara makes loads of great eating suggestions nearby . We loved staying and will be back. Thank you Sara. "
2736358,109175580,2017-04-03T16:13:46Z,"Just perfect. GREAT location, very accessible to everything and could catch an Uber/Lyft within 2 minutes anytime.  The way the apartment is situated makes it quiet and peaceful. The furnishings and description is entirely accurate.  A wonderful local grocery nearby lets you buy necessities (food, wine), but Sara keeps the basics well stocked (TP, towels).  Very comfortable, great atmosphere and highly recommend.  "
2736358,4694687,2017-03-30T17:54:41Z,I highly recommend Sara's place. It is very conveniently located at a great location (walking distance to many coffee shops and restaurants and golden gate park). The apartment is very cute and has access to a fantastic little garden. The public transportation works perfect to reach to all other SF districts. Sara is an excellent host. She was very very friendly and communicative during my stay and answered my questions promptly. I highly recommend. 
2736358,115354734,2017-03-23T16:36:56Z,"We would highly recommend Sara's space! We felt like we truly had an authentic San Francisco experience! Take advantage of Sara's restaurant and bar recommendations! Staying so close to Haight/Ashbury gives you so many options! The space was just right for the 3 of us. Quaint, beautifully decorated, and clean!"
2736358,72544434,2017-03-17T15:53:12Z,"El apartamento de Sara está bien decorado, limpio y es tal y como lo muestra en las fotos. Es una buena anfitriona que mantiene contacto por si tienes alguna duda. Sin duda lo recomiendo "
2736358,48714674,2017-03-08T20:00:17Z,"Sara's apartment is at the back of her home overlooking her garden. It is within easy walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops and all that Haight has to offer. It is an easy drive to the Golden Gate bridge, Sausalito, fisherman's Warf and Marina. All of which we thoroughly enjoyed! "
2736358,21744429,2017-03-04T19:58:55Z,"Absolutely adorable, cozy, and convenient! Sara was hospitable and available. I look forward to recommending and hopefully staying again next time I'm in the city! "
2736358,105624583,2017-02-28T18:05:45Z,"Sara is a great host - super friendly and communicative. Her apartment has a great location, 1 block from Haight-Ashbury with great shopping/food/drink/nightlife options on your doorstep but on a quiet residential street. We went to see the famous 'painted ladies' but to be honest Sara's neighbourhood has a far more beautiful housing stock and architecture. There are also a couple of beautiful parks nearby with amazing views. Every other neighbourhood of SF is within a 10-15min drive so this is the perfect base to explore from. Thanks Sara!"
2736358,94337442,2017-02-21T17:55:01Z,"Great place, prime location for anyone looking to experience San Fran as a local. We loved our stay and Sara is a fantastic host."
2736358,15211318,2017-02-13T17:02:55Z,"""If you're going to San Francisco..."" Presuming you are of a certain age, you'll recognize those lyrics. And if you have a hankering to stay in the beautiful Haight district, you'll do well to consider staying in this ground level apartment with a handsome backyard patio overflowing with vegetation. Conveniently located near bus and train lines, as well as the sprawling Golden Gate Park, this apartment offers quiet and comfortable solitude only a couple blocks away from lively Haight Street. Cole Vally is nearby, offering a great breakfast and brunch restaurant, upscale cheese and wine shops, and an awesome ice cream bar sporting a decor straight out of Archie comics. We were in the city both for business and pleasure, and did a lot of traveling around town and the Bay Area generally. It was always a pleasure to return in the evening to the sedate comforts of this Airbnb. Also, our host was highly responsive to our queries and flexible too. Highly recommend."
2736358,10903201,2017-02-06T19:55:58Z,We had great experience while our stay in Sara's place. The neighborhood is quiet but the area is also busy. The apartment is very clean and newly decorated and fashionable. We love her apartment and the yard!
2736358,106393613,2017-01-30T18:46:21Z,This place is awesome! Sara is helpful and attentive. We enjoyed being in a local area with beautiful architecture and very close to everything you'd like to visit. The space is very cozy and quaint. Absolutely would recommend and would book again!!!
2736358,8641307,2017-01-26T18:48:49Z,"This was a great place right off Haight.  I really loved the location - 15 minute walk to Golden Gate Park and tons of shops / cafes / restaurants on Haight, 1 block and half away.  The place is a 1 bedroom with a great area to hang out in.  You also have access to the backyard.  Sara, the host, was great work with.  "
2736358,22167624,2017-01-22T19:58:36Z,Perfect Haight Ashbury apartment. I loved the fireplace and garden backyard. Sara was wonderful. I would definitely be back! 
4351047,121641456,2017-05-05T16:46:51Z,"Dear Ling and David

Thank you very much.
It became the best vacation. I appreciate your graceful communication correspondence. I tell my friends that this staying was great excitement.

Regards

Rie and Atsushi"
4351047,99154403,2017-04-21T23:41:25Z,"incredible view!  staying here is worth that alone.  if you're on a budget, stay downstairs...if you can spend for the top place (the retreat) it's worth it.  if you're sensitive to footstep sound/a light sleeper or working while staying at the hideaway it's not ideal but still a beautiful spot on earth."
4351047,65870456,2017-04-14T18:47:21Z,The best place we have stayed on the west coast by far. Absolutely stunning views and an exceptional apartment. Will definitely be returning.
4351047,5027636,2017-04-08T18:38:21Z,Incredible view day and night! If you've ever wanted a rustic cabin on top of a canyon to gaze at the pacific... this is the place to go!! 
4351047,53843351,2017-03-18T18:49:57Z,"You cannot beat this beautiful view of Malibu! The hideaway was a quiet, peaceful and private location. We enjoyed having breakfast on the deck each morning with freshly squeezed juice from the citrus trees. The drive up to the house can be intimidating, but after a few times we felt comfortable. FYI- there is no air conditioning, and if other guests are staying in the unit upstairs you can hear a lot of noise- but these were minor details. Overall, our stay was perfect. Highly recommended. "
4351047,571643,2017-02-26T19:44:21Z,This place is wonderful! Wish we could extend our stay by few more days just to enjoy the house. 
4351047,60733080,2017-02-23T18:36:09Z,Fabulous
4351047,39153424,2017-02-18T19:22:55Z,"Had a fantastic stay here, thank you so much David and Ling. Everything was perfect and it is a very special hideaway property. "
4351047,72921396,2017-02-12T18:33:20Z,"What a beautiful place to stay, we were pretty much in awe the entire time! The view is impeccable and it truly doesn't matter the weather or time of day, you either feel like you're floating in the clouds or flying above the land below. You can see the ocean in the distance and little cars coming up the hills. The drive is only about 5-10 minutes up but was so awe-striking and pleasant each time we did it. The home itself is beautiful designed and very clean. We felt very at home making meals for ourselves and enjoying time outside on the patio, or around the home in the gardens. We also juiced oranges from the property and had an insanely coloured (and delicious) blood orange juice. This place is truly a gem, it was amazing to stay here! "
4351047,24343974,2017-02-03T19:39:09Z,"The best place in Malibu! Perfect! 非常非常喜欢!开车到吃喝玩乐个景点都很方便。非常华丽的大别墅,内部设施很舒适,海景山景超级棒!完美!"
4351047,59072549,2017-01-29T16:41:35Z,"The view is amazing, we will never forget it!!! The place is very cosy and relaxing, everything was very clean. The roads to access the house are safe but steep, so I recommend to get there as first time during the day. There are very good restaurants and markets at the PCH, we enjoyed very much Nobu and Malibu Farm at the pier. We surely come back someday!!! "
4351047,9786359,2017-01-09T16:45:46Z,we had a wonderful time at Ling and David's amazingly gorgeous place. The view is spectacular and the apartment extremely cosy and well equipped. Our hosts were very responsive and welcoming. I would recommend this place to anyone
4351047,27611218,2017-01-02T17:18:01Z,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! This place was fantastic. The pictures don't do it justice. Epic views. 

Ling and David were very sweet and accommodating. 

Great place to stay for a romantic getaway. "
4351047,54628310,2016-12-22T19:20:09Z,"This canyon bungalow with ocean view will stun you. David and Ling were easy and delightful to communicate with. We loved awaking to the sunrise, enjoying peaceful breakfasts on the patio under the bugambilia flowers, reading and journaling by the fountain, watching the hummingbirds buzz by, and finding a sancutary for rest. I love to cook fresh meals, and found the kitchen to be well eqipped. The bed was comfortable. The shower had excellent water pressure. The extra towels and linens were useful. There were two beach chairs and a beach umbrella that came in handy for our trips to nearby Point Dume beach. There was even a yoga mat for my morning practice overlooking the terraine.

The following are some notes that by no means should these discourage a visit, but are good to know. When the unit above is booked, you can hear most everything. If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs just in case. Second, if you are on the shorter side (I am), or have physical limitations (I do), know that you'll have to stand on a chair to get kitchen items off of high shelves or to use the microwave, as the kitchen is made for a tall person.

We did not want to leave this retreat! We will be back. Thank you, David and Ling! You own a piece of paradise."
4351047,34067785,2016-12-11T16:46:31Z,Incredible views from everywhere in the house. I loved picking fresh tangerines from the beautifully landscaped garden and enjoying them with a cup of tea as I looked out over the ocean. Definitely a peaceful retreat for those who need to unwind! Thank you!
4351047,100359799,2016-12-04T19:33:59Z,Beautiful hideaway location with breathtaking views. Will return 
4351047,43818240,2016-11-24T17:17:10Z,Such an amazing experience!! Must book!! I can't wait to come back!! The views are amazing!! This location Comes as advertise!! Very nice people to work with as well!!!  
4351047,14035551,2016-11-21T17:44:30Z,"The place is ideal if you would like to get away from civilization and be close to it at the same time. The apartment is very romantic. The view could not be much better. David was very helpful and very easy to reach when needed. Beaches, restaurants, shops are within a short drive."
4351047,68622604,2016-10-07T18:10:48Z,"Lovely views and tranquility in the hills - We were certainly nervous with the mountain roads to travel back and forth to the apartment, but probably should have realised this when booking - if you are used to high mountain roads I'm sure it will not bother you, but we just took our own leisurely time to cope. 

When the apartment above is occupied, you can hear most movements and sound.  Nothing you could do about this, just a feature.

Please don't view any of the above as a criticism, just observations.  David responded really quickly to any questions and was very helpful at all times.  The apartment was clean and presented well.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

6281438,85444047,2017-05-11T12:39:27Z,"Beautiful house, tall airy rooms with good air con or fan as you wanted. One of the benefits of staying at Arianna's place is that one of her colleagues, Steve is also a tour guide with his own American classic car. Great fun and very knowledgeable about Cuba. Not only that but he's a cigar specialist, even if you dont't smoke the cigar story is fascinating. Want too know all the best places to eat - talk to Steve! "
6281438,47941243,2017-04-30T15:20:41Z,"The casa is just as described.  Ariana is a tremendous host and you can tell she is constantly making efforts to upgrade the casa--highly recommend!

Check-in was easy, the casa was extrodinarily clean, private bathroom, and Arriana arranged everything for us - transportation, gave recommendations and even had wifi.  The location of the casa was very convenient and safe in the lovely neighborhood of Vedado and just a short cab ride to Habana Vieja.  Definately hope to return and will certainly stay at Arriana's casa. "

6281438,110343806,2017-03-15T15:56:39Z,"Arriana'S Spanish Mansion was the nicest AirB&B we stayed. It's super clean, very beautiful and authentic, great showers and delicious breakfasts. The staff was very kind and it's well located. I will spend all of my Havana days there for sure next year!!!!"
6281438,43336919,2017-02-15T04:36:07Z,Ariannas home is even more impressive in person. Staff are very helpful and its very easy to get a taxi to Havana Vieja or any other area. The house is very clean and it was overall a very relaxing and enjoyable stay!

6281438,1505238,2017-02-03T16:41:38Z,"Casa Arianna, was basically like a boutique hotel. The location eas superb because it was close to main places/attractions with being noisy. The decoration was very tasteful and they help you with sugestions, taxis, etc.
If I return to Cuba soon, I will definitly stay there again!

6281438,94415460,2017-01-16T13:07:14Z,Highly recommend it. My son (12 years old) and I had the best time ever. The staff in Ariannas house are simply the best. The House is extremely clean and everything you read about Ariannas house is accurate. I would definitely go back and stay in her house. Next time It will be longer. 4 days in Havana is not enough.. Thank you for everything. Hasta pronto. 
6281438,57227306,2017-01-13T14:33:58Z,Arianna's place is amazing. We had a great stay made even better by the friendly and helpful staff. We Will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Havana.

She let us drop our bags early and even left us some fresh fruit along with a bottle of champagne. Would love to stay here again on our next trip to Florence. Grazie Mille Teresa! "
2662643,29530402,2017-05-08T08:47:03Z,"This is a really spacious apartment close to everything in Florence. We loved being close to the Duomo (maybe a ten minute walk, probably less) and The Central Market (Mercato Centrale, five minute walk. Being able to make pit stops between museums was great. For those that don't want to do a ton of planning (but read these reviews) I do think the Firenze card is an amazing and convenient option to see whatever you want without a line, and walk back to the apartment when you need to get off your feet. If you have 2- 3 days and like art it's an amazing option that pairs well with a centrally located apartment. Take your time and enjoy this awesome launchpad into the heart of the action!"
2662643,86451887,2017-05-03T08:38:10Z,"산타노벨라 역에서 일단 가까워서 좋았습니다.
횡단보도를 2번 건너야하긴 했지만 찾기 쉬웠구요.
숙소 바로 옆 건물에 슈퍼마켓이 있어서 물과 간단한 먹거리 사기에 편리했어요. 가죽시장이 걸어서 2분 거리라 가족들 선물 구입한 후 숙소에 놓고 다시 관광할 수 있어서 그게 제일 좋았네요. 산타노벨라 성당도 가깝구요. 숙소 자체는 사진보다 오래되어 보였긴하지만 빈티지한 이탈리안 숙소 느낌을 체험할 수 있어서 좋았어요. 공간도 아주 넓어서 지내는데 불편함은 없었습니다. 후기에서 봤듯이 집주인이 샴페인, 음료, 과일을 준비해 주셔서 지내는 동안 그것으로 아침 해결했네요... 가격대비 좋은 숙소입니다."
2662643,72899334,2017-05-01T07:41:42Z,"This is a very good, spacious and well maintained apartment. It is a 5-10 minutes walk from the train station, and also 5-10 minutes walk to buses that take you to all attractions in Florence. Of course, to many of them you can walk for 20-30 minutes to go there if you do not want to take the bus.  In the same street there is a small supermarket where you can get what you wish.  There was enough cutlery, pans, etc, if you wanted to cook. We were lazy and had breakfast at MacDonalds (about 10 minutes, too, from the apartment), and eat out the other times because we were all over town.  There is a regular size fridge in the apartment where we kept what we bought at the supermarket.  
This was a very comfortable and good place to stay. "

It is a 5 min walk to the train, 5 minutes to the most amazing market, and 10 min to the duomo and river.  It's older, but spotless and suited our family perfectly.

We had a perfect holiday able to explore all of Florence on foot. Apartment was well located for us to come back for a rest before heading out for the evening aperitivo! Teresa was extremely well organised and kind - keeping our luggage in her shop when we arrived very early and leaving us gifts of wine, cakes and fruit. Much appreciated Teresa! Would highly recommend the apartment- spacious for our family of four, lots of character, great location (yet quiet) Hope to return someday. Thanks again for your excellent hospitality Teresa. "

2662643,40527584,2017-03-28T06:32:48Z,"We loved our stay at Teresa's flat.  The location could not be any better!  It is literally 2 blocks from the Duomo and San Marco market.  I lived in Italy years ago and for travelers, the location does not get better than this.  I was traveling alone with my 3 teenagers and we felt safe at all times.  The flat itself is charming!  Bed were comfortable.  Teresa left us drinks and morning treats so that we had something to eat before starting our day.  Teresa is just a lovely women, accommodating and professional. Our arrival was set for before check-in time but Teresa was able to let us in to drop bags.  She also was kind enough to go out of her way to fedex me medication we forgot to our next location - I cannot thank her enough for that!  Truly, I was more than pleased and excited for our stay, and Teresa and the flat made things even better.  I had not expected to go back to the flat during the day or before dinner but it was so convenient that we stopped by to  drop off bags and pick up a sweater several times.  This was a total bonus!"
2662643,1474040,2017-03-25T09:29:19Z,"A great location and very cute, spacious, and comfortable place.  It was an easy walk from the train station, and then walkable to all the main sites in Florence.  We took a day trip to Assisi from Florence, and the convenience to the train station made it so easy to do.  

It was spacious everywhere - bedroom, foyer, kitchen, and living space.   We loved the feel of the neighborhood and just walking a few steps to get groceries, coffee, and dinner.

Teresa's son met us there and gave us some great tips on things to see and where to eat.  Teresa had also kindly done some research that we asked for regarding events or concerts that were happening during our stay.  

Florence is a wonderful city, and Teresa's place is a great way to feel like a local for a short time.  We stay six nights and wish we could have stayed more.    "

You are three blocks away from the copacabana and their grounds can be used for 15 CUC per day.  You can also use their wifi there or across from the local swimming pool with a wifi card.

From transfer arrangements to and from the airport to the all in important dinner and lunch reservations, Geisys went above and beyond the call of duty.  The apartment was as pictured, clean and perfect for two guest.  Located approximately 15 minutes from Havana be sure to budget for transportation cost.  Cabs are readily available at Copacabana Hotel which is two short blocks away.  You can also exchange currency at the hotel if needed. A market and several restaurants are within walking distance.  Overall the apartment paired with the Geisys's awesome customer services made for a spectacular trip.  We will return and have already recommended Geisys's apartment to five other travelers. "

7161948,16439328,2017-02-28T03:37:46Z,"Die Unterkunft war mehr als eine 5 Sterne Bewertung wert. Alles absolut so vorgefunden wie es beschrieben war. Die Wohnung war mit eigenen Kunstwerken der Gastgeberin geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Geisy war eine Super Gastgeberin. Sie kümmert sich liebevoll um ihre Gaeste. Interessante Gespräche mit Ihr sowohl als kluge, offene und aufgeschlossene Frau als auch als interessante Kuenstlerin rundeten einen Spitzenaufenthalt in Ihrer Wohnung ab. Ich habe mich 14 Tage bei Ihr in der Wohnung sicher und wohlgefuehlt. Sollten in der Wohnung oder sonstige Probleme in Havanna auftauchen ist sie sofort hilfsbereit zur Stelle. Einen herzlichen Dank an Geisy fuer einen tollen Aufenthalt in einem Spitzenappartment. "

She helped us figure out how much to pay for a cab, local restaurants, and a map to old Havana made by one of her friends. Would highly recommend staying here!"
7161948,5917907,2017-02-01T15:34:37Z,"Staying at Geisys place was fantastic. She is so friendly, helping with everything even when we had a very early flight. The apartment is clean, simple and very comfortable. The huge bed is great! Geisys even left us eggs and fruit for breakfast. The area is a great part of Havana, you have to get a taxi into town but you can barter on the price! It's near a couple of big hotels where you can use the pool. We really enjoyed our stay thanks Geisys! X"

momento en que entramos a su apartamento y fuimos recibidos por ella misma tan calurosamente, hasta cada detalle que cuidadosamente preparo para nosotros (frutas frescas, pan, leche, café y más). A quienes deseen visitar Cuba no duden en escoger esta opción. 

Our experience at Geisys's place was wonderful. She greeted us personally and made sure we were comfortable. She took the time to recommend restaurants, transportation and she gave us useful information. She provided amazing coffee, eggs, bread, and bananas. She was always easy to reach. We highly recommend staying at Geisy's place if you visit Havana."
7161948,32921832,2017-01-15T16:40:03Z,"What a lovely, romantic and refreshing experience to stay at Gei 's place! The apartment is fresh, with wonderful decoration, and equipped with anything you might need during your stay. Highly recommend to get some groceries and have your breakfast in the nice terrace, the area is quiet and lovely, and we found this the best way to start  our day while in Havana.
The area is close to the beach, restaurants and some hotels but if you prefer to be in Havana Vieja/centro every day, be prepared to pay 20-30 USD on taxi to go & return.

About Geisys, really cannot say enough to express how joyful, kind and helpful she has been, not only for restaurants/bars etc, but also for providing us accomodation solution for the two extra days elsewhere, as her own apt was not available.
"
7161948,652011,2017-01-13T14:18:10Z,"Geisys's apartment is clean, comfortable, well-equipped, and stylishly decorated, and Geisys herself is a lovely, kind, helpful person.  She provided eggs, fruit, bottled water, coffee, sugar, etc.  There's a hair dryer and an iron, and a housekeeper comes to clean the apartment every other day.  It's just two blocks from the Hotel Copacabana, so you can easily walk to the hotel to have a drink, use the Internet, or catch a cab.  Although I haven't seen any of the rooms at the Hotel Copacabana, I suspect Geisys's apartment is much more comfortable than any of them and at a fraction of the cost.  The neighborhood is pleasant and quiet, and there are some fantastic bars, cafes, and restaurants nearby.  (Our favorites were Cafe Fortuna and the Paladar El Paleo.)  However, it is a bit far from central Havana, and cabs into town can be expensive.  We were generally charged about 15 CUC each way.  In theory, one can catch a collectivo for 1 CUC, but every time we tried, all of the collectivos were full.  So we eventually gave up and just paid for private cabs.  All in all, though, we were happy with Geisys's apartment and we were enchanted by Geisys herself.  We would stay here again. "
7161948,24795020,2017-01-02T14:20:18Z,"I can't say enough wonderful things about Geisys or her home! The apartment was exactly as advertised (extremely clean and well stocked) and she provided excellent recommendations for local places to eat, including some good breakfast spots. The unit is very close to the Copacabana Hotel (which has a rock pool, in addition to a regular pool) and many other nice hotels with pools that sell day passes (I recommend the Melia Hotel in Miramar). Geisys also coordinated a fantastic, professional driver for us, an official city tour, and a private art tour with her friend (who was also wonderful!!). I highly recommend checking out Gei's art, as she is very talented! Geisys is not just a host, she is a true friend who clearly cares deeply about providing a unique and special experience for her guests. Next time my husband and I visit Cuba, we will stay with Gei!!"
7161948,703403,2016-12-26T15:44:20Z,"We had such a lovely experience here. Geisys was super helpful, kind, and accommodating. The apartment was clean and comfortable, a perfect little place to recharge and relax in the midst of so much amazing stimulation that Havana offers. We enjoyed staying a bit outside of old Havana as it provided a more authentic experience of daily life beyond the world of tourism. But also very easy walk out the front door and find a taxi into the city center. It was just a 10 minute ride which is always fun as the taxi's are a great experience in and of themselves. Especially for vintage car enthusiasts. All in all we had a wonderful experience and felt 100% comfortable with Geisys and the space she has created for her guests. "
7161948,18168381,2016-12-23T16:17:11Z,"Geisy's apartment was really cute - you wouldn't guess that it looked like that inside when you're walking in. She also gave a good list of places for us to check out which we found useful. The bed is huge, probably a Cal King, and the A/C is refreshing since it's so humid. I wish it was a bit closer to Central Havana but it wasn't a huge deal, it ended up being about a $8 cab ride each way."
100858,78305946,2017-04-11T09:47:21Z,"Wonderful apartment , close enough to transit , and of course very close to the Eiffel Tower , but along with comes a lot of tourists and noise ,but overall a great place to stay  "
100858,34937937,2017-03-31T07:37:25Z,"Charles' place was better than expected.  You can't even begin to imagine how beautiful and extraordinary his home is.  Not only did we pick the perfect place to rent but Marie and Pierre (Charles' parents) were extremely helpful leading up to our arrival and during our stay.  I felt more than prepared to arrive to just enjoy the trip without any worries.  The view during sunrise was probably one of the prettiest sites I've ever seen.  If you go to Paris and want a true Parisian visit with a great view, Charles' place is the one for you!"
100858,16858140,2017-03-19T08:11:02Z,"I cannot rave enough about this little gem in Paris! 
First of all, the view of the Eiffel tower is magnificent and you can pretty much see it from every part of the apartment due to all the mirrors placed throughout. We loved laying in bed at night and watch the twinkling light show on the hour! Wow! The location is in a more residential part of Paris, so we really got a feel of local culture away from the tourist bustle, but we are still close enough to be apart of it if we wanted to. People watching from the apartment and from the balcony was great! Since we are in the city, there will be some street noise at night and during the day, but we found that authentic and charming. Metro stations are close by and a bus station right outside the apartment's main door made getting around very convenient. The neighborhood has small wine, cheese, pastry and food stores for easy shopping.
The apartment was FULLY stocked! Marie and Charles are excellent hosts and communication was great. Each and every one of our concerns and questions throughout our planning process were addressed quickly and informatively. Although we didn't cook while we were there, you definitely could as the kitchen was fully equipped. Marie and Charles went above and beyond in stocking the apartment with so much essentials that made us feel right at home and we felt so worry free. Our week staying at the apt. really made us feel like we were living in Paris! We were sad to leave! The bathroom is updated and the shower is really awesome! The steam shower is a great way to end a day having been on our feet sight seeing and walking around the city.  Unfortunately, we were not able to meet Marie in person, but we got to meet Charles. Such a pleasant and personable person and gave us lots of insight into his city and his insider tips to bakeries and shops. He even brought us croissants in the morning! I cannot stress how easy and wonderful our experience was as first timers in Paris! Marie & Charles love what they do and it shows! 
We hope to come back to Paris soon and we will definitely try to book this place again, if it is available.
Thank you Marie & Charles! You have made our experience unforgettable! Merci Beaucoup!"
100858,1354964,2017-03-04T09:46:13Z,"Charles's apartment is truly fantastic.

The obvious: the view really is that good. In fact, it's probably better than you think it is. There are enormous windows along the entire balcony, and there are mirrors throughout the apartment so that you can watch the Eiffel tower twinkle at night; there's a great view of the grand palais and the sacre coeur off the balcony as well. It's a breathtaking view when its cloudy, rainy, sunny or nighttime. 

The apartment facilities are also quite lovely. Everything was clean and in working order. The kitchen has a nice induction range that is great for cooking eggs, and a nespresso machine. The fridge is spacious. There is a dishwasher, washing machine and dryer that helped us save time and packing space. The shower is fantastic, with good water pressure; it has handheld, rainfall and waterfall shower heads as well as a built in steam shower. The bed is comfortable and the common areas are very open feeling. There is a (small) elevator that efficiently takes you up to the eighth floor, and there are key-fob activated security gates at every entrance to the building.

The location is also great for a visitor to Paris. You are right on the border of the 7th arr (highly touristy with the Eiffel Tower, Rodin museum and Napoleon's tomb) and the 15th arr (much more residential, with great fromageries, boulangeries and a fantastic farmers market twice a week). It is a short walk to the metro stops at Champ de Mars, Bir Hakeim and La Motte-Picquette-Grenelle. There are also many useful (and scenic) bus lines that leave right below the apartment's balcony (including the #69 which makes an excellent self-guided bus tour--see Rick Steves's Paris book). 

Marie (Charles's mom) was a lovely host, and she and her husband spent a lot of time helping us get settled and checked in with us every few days to make sure things were going well. 

All in all we couldn't recommend our stay at Charles's apartment more highly."
100858,11852711,2017-02-25T10:06:55Z,"It is a spacious, modern flat with fantastic views over Paris from most of the flat. We loved watching the light show on the Eiffel Tower from our living room. Shops and restaurants are only minutes away. We were very happy with everything that we wanted in the flat. Marie  is very helpful too and meets you on arrival."
100858,4446305,2017-02-11T07:30:15Z,This is an amazing rental. The flat and the hosts combine to make your stay in Paris incredible. Recommend staying here. 
100858,34793540,2016-12-12T07:21:19Z,"Don't hesitate. Just book this amazing apartment.  It will exceed all and any expectations. The view of the Eiffel Tower and gardens and views back to Sacre Couer dazzle. The location has awesome access to transport, restaurants, food, wine, cheese and local markets. Most of all you will truly appreciate the genuine and caring welcome extended by the hosts. It shines through. Merci beaucoup Charles, Marie and Pierre. We will be back. Glennys and Wayne. Australia"
100858,23906199,2016-11-01T02:11:04Z,"Words cannot express how marvelous this property is!!!  If you want to experience the real Paris & Eiffel tower, this apartment is a must.  We have so enjoyed meeting and getting to know Pierre &  Marie,  they are a true Parisian  joy!!!!  Whatever you need, whether its shopping, dining, sightseeing or just having a glass of wine together they are there to assist you. The apartment is immaculate and well appointed with beautiful linens.  The bed is very comfortable along with the best steam shower.  After a day of sightseeing soaking up all of what Paris has to offer you come back to the apartment, pop a bottle of champagne sit back and wait for the Eiffel Tower to sparkle welcoming you home...then comes the steam shower...ooh-la-la!
Enjoy my fellow travelers... "
100858,46030792,2016-10-09T08:36:00Z,"The description and pictures are perfectly accurate, but what they don't provide a sense for, are the magnificient hosts, Marie and Pierre (who was at the door step when we arrived, and gave us the warmest welcome), insisted that they help with our luggage, and provided fantastic recommendations around the city. The location is perfect, with city bus lines 42, 69 and 82 that will fulfill most, if not all transportation needs for the typical tourist - taking a bus is one of the best choices we've made staying there, all the sights minus any safety concerns ... I initially had some reservations about staying in the 7th/15th arrondisement but my concerns quickly dissipated once I discovered how convenient and easy it is to get groceries and food/restaurants (Vin & Maree just steps away is a must do !). Thanks Marie for your kind hosting, and I look forward to returning in the future !"
100858,73105304,2016-09-03T08:58:58Z,"This apartment (and the entire experience) was above and beyond our exceptions.  We were welcomed like family and felt completely at home. The apartment had wonderful amenities and was stocked with everything we could possibly need.  We hope to return soon and spend more time in this fabulous location!  The view of the Eiffel tower was so beautiful, and our hosts were so helpful with all sorts of advice and resources to make sure that our stay was absolutely perfect.  "
100858,11131999,2016-08-03T02:44:00Z,"We use Airbnb every year for trips & this by far has been our favorite. Not only did it exceed our expectations but the graciousness of Marie, Pierre and Charles was far beyond what we expected. From the first time I contacted Marie to inquire about the property to the night before we left she made every effort to provide information regularly and to check in to inquire of our plans (that way she could offer suggestions if needed--car service, suggestions for sights to see, restaurant suggestion, answering questions not only about the property but also responding to requests such as for help for the best way to go to see the Tour de France (yes, we were lucky enough to be in town at the end of it!) and helping us plan for our son to travel from Paris the day we arrived to Tigne France where it was another 3 1/2 hour train ride and a three hour shuttle ride to get there. All within 1 hour of arriving from the USA. We were lucky enough to meet Charles who was in town for business (and who is every bit as lovely as his parents!) He contacted us the evening prior to arrival to make sure everything would flow smoothly and he was waiting outside the flat when we arrived. He then gave us a quick tour and demonstrated how everything in the flat worked and then helped us call a cab to take our son to Gar de Lyon as we were on a super tight schedule. Upon arriving back at the flat we had a more leisurely chance to enjoy the view, all the lovely amenities and the treats left (macaroons and champagne) as well as being grateful for the basics left in the fridge. Milk, beer, water, coke, etc. Our favorite things about the flat..the view, the view, the view. As if you could touch the Tour Eiffel. Enjoyed it in the morning drinking coffee on the lovely outdoor patio (espresso maker and plenty of pods in the flat!), and loving it as the sun set and at night when she twinkled. The steam shower! Having a spa experience every day in your own home for free. Heaven! And the pictures for the bath do NOT do it justice. The comfortable bed and EVERY amenity you could need or forgot to bring there for you. What I have not liked about some of our past Airbnb experiences was that they left barely any toilet paper, one bar of soap, no paper towels or laundry soap etc. Marie had EVERYTHING stocked with plenty for the duration of our stay as well as extra in the vanity (perfume, bandaids, lotion, lovely body wash and shampoo in the shower) etc. It was if you were staying somewhere where they really liked or loved you and they wanted to make sure you had absolutely everything you could want...Merci beacoup, dieu tu benisse dear Charles family! "
100858,10370432,2016-07-13T01:55:12Z,"This place could not be any better. Many airbnb places have carefully curated photos to make it seem better; if anything, this is nearly the opposite. It is a beautiful modern place with a great kitchen and steam shower ... and the view is spectacular. I cannot recommend this place high enough -- and the kindness of Charles and his family is twice as important as the view and the apartment. "
100858,12162095,2016-05-31T02:39:24Z,"A take your breathe away apartment in the city of light.  We have stayed at Air BnB's in NYC, London, Scotland, Ireland, Vancouver Canada, New Orleans, Montana, and Charles place is in the top ""2"".  Location and view are the tops.  The apartments has a super kitchen, nice bedroom, an over the top bathroom and plenty of space for a couple.  The ""cherry"" on the top of sundae is the warm and thoughtful greeting and interactions with Marie and Pierre.  They turn a normal stay in an ""Air BnB Bonus"" stay.  The pre arrival emails and information along with the arrival briefing and the continued ""check in's"" assisted in making our stay in Paris a superior vacation.    "
100858,22220654,2016-04-17T02:38:58Z,"Outstanding experience! Charles' apartment lived up to every photo and every expectation we had of it. Great location with easy access to the Métro, RER and bus; amazing view of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coeur. The apartment has all the amenities (and then some)  -- dishwasher, washer/dryer and very nice kitchen; steam shower; stereo, satellite TV and fast Internet. More than anything, though, we felt so well taken care of by Marie and Pierre. They greeted us upon arrival and explained every detail (providing great recommendations in the neighborhood) and then checked in on us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. Thank you so much!"
100858,55480703,2016-04-02T14:03:41Z,"Minha estadia em Paris foi realmente premiada com este apartamento.     

O clima da casa é extremamente acolhedor e funcional, o que me permitiu uma estadia tranquila e proveitosa.

Acolhedor pela vista, pelos anfitriões (os pais do dono do imóvel, pessoas gentilíssimas, amáveis, disponíveis e super atentas à qualquer necessidade que aparecesse) e pela localização (com metro próximo). 

Funcional pela estrutura em geral; desde cozinha equipada, banheiro com ducha perfeita, calefação ajustada, ótimo quarto; até os pequenos detalhes, como as várias tomadas espalhadas pela casa, que fazem toda a diferença na hora de usar o computador. 

Uma ótima opção passar um tempo na cidade. 

  "
100858,50767812,2016-02-20T12:01:12Z,"Our hosts, Marie and Pierre made us feel  as if we were welcomed friends from abroad! Every detail from apartment amenities to  thoughtful flowers, delicious maccarrons and chocolate, and special champagne put us in the mood to enjoy Paris immediately. The detailed maps with recommendations for sights and restaurants were spot on and made for confident daily excursions. Marie truely went out of her way to make our stay so special. We cannot wait to return!"
100858,52770887,2016-02-11T12:37:50Z,"Charles' apartment is gorgeous with a modern touch and a cozy feeling. Features like the steamer, walkout balcony and washer/dryer helped make our honeymoon extra special.  The location of the apartment is perfect, with a perfect view of the eiffel tower (Oh, and mirrors inside that let you see the tower from all rooms), and access to the busses and Metro right outside. Having the bus stops outside the door made seeing Paris a breeze. 

For our honeymoon, Charles went all out, leaving champagne, macaroons, and rose petals for our arrival. There is also an awesome binder full of suggestions for restaurants and sites. 

Words don't do justice for how amazing the apartment is and how lucky we were to get Charles' apartment."
100858,27142316,2016-01-27T12:01:39Z,"Just came back from Paris. My husband and I stayed in Charles’ apartment for ten days. It was perfect. The location is quite convenient, close to everything. Within 10 mins walk, you can get RER C, Metro 6 and Metro 8, 3 lines can take you to every popular spot in the city.  There is a supermarket right next to the building, a great place for daily supply shopping. Plenty of dining choices in walking distance. The view from the room is fabulous.  Having breakfast in PJs with Tour Eiffel is quite an extraordinary experience. Marie is attentive, welcoming and resourceful. Marie and Pierre gave us the warmest welcome upon arrival. The first greeting was “Welcome home” I am so touched… They introduced the room and a lot of useful information to getting around. You can find everything you need in the apartment. It really feels like home. Do not hesitate to book this apartment! Can not wait to have my next stay. "
100858,26763904,2016-01-05T10:59:21Z,"My wife and I had the pleasure of ringing in 2016 in this truly fantastic property.  

Marie and Pierre gave us the warmest welcome upon our arrival and were in continues contact with us throughout our stay.  They really do want you to have an enjoyable stay and the best possible time while in Paris.  They really are just The Best hosts and all around great people.  

Some of the highlights for us were:
-The Welcome macaroons and champagne that you see in the photos-it really is waiting when you get there!
-The book cabinet. It was great seeing all the Paris guide books from different authors, along with maps and other city information right there to thumb through.  Even though we had done plenty of research before coming, it was great to have additional information.
 -The view and the balcony.  Let's be real: that view is what all of our Paris dreams are made of.  And with the huge balcony and unobstructed view, it really doesn't get any better.
-The bathroom.  Words cannot describe how AMAZING this bathroom is.  That steam shower.  Oh my gosh.  Just the best.  We used it every single day of our trip.  Coming back after a day running around, especially if it had been damp and dreary, this was like a slice of heaven.  And with all the wonderful rain and waterfall shower heads.  I'm telling you,  it was like a spa and worth every penny of the rental fee.  

Additionally, the apartment is in a really nice area and is generally pretty quite after dark, which we enjoyed.  The Champ de Mars RER and the Bir-Hakeim Metro stops were both a little more than five minutes walk away and really did connect you to anything in the city.  We found all the appliances we used, including the washer, dryer, oven, Nespresso and microwave all worked and were great to have on hand.  

Staying at in this apartment felt like we were staying in the most luxurious penthouse in Paris.  Thanks again to Marie, Pierre and Charles and for giving us a New Year we will always remember."
100858,30103176,2015-11-25T10:43:40Z,"Marie and Pierre were fabulous hosts.  And the apartment was simply divine.  We truly enjoyed the comforts of home, shopping the local markets and so much more.  We just couldn't get enough of the amazing view, day and night.  And, we are sure to return again!"

Es ist einfach eingerichtet, hat sehr viel Charme und alles, was benötigt wird ist vorhanden. Fahrräder, Strandliegen und Sonnenschirme sind zum ausleihen da, der Pool darf mitbenützt werden, Parkplatz gratis vor der Tür. Paola und ihr Mann sind ganz tolle Gastgeber! Unbedingt ins Cafe Creme für Frühstück oder Mittag/Abendessen..wir liebten es. Und Paola macht dort super gute Bruschettas ;) Wir sind unkomplizierte Reisende und störten uns nicht darüber, dass das kleine Badezimmer keine Türe hatte. Der tolle Ort Bal Harbour ist mit dem Auto in 10 Min zu erreichen. Tipps und Infos einfach bei Paola oder ihrem Mann erfragen. "

The appartment itself is in the garden of the house of Paola, next to the swimmingpool. It is cosy, but big enough."

Trotzdem und leider haben wir uns in der Unterkunft und der Umgebung überhaupt nicht wohl gefühlt und haben uns entschlossen, nach nur 1 Nacht aus zu checken. Die Unterkunft hatte für uns Garagen Charakter, leider kein Fenster und das Badezimmer, viel zu klein. Die Unterkunft selber sehr sauber.  Der Garten ist schon wie auf den Fotos, bisschen mehr Pflege würde ihm gut tun. Das Preis Leistungs Verhältnis passt leider überhaupt nicht. "

1525686,68859036,2017-04-06T17:54:53Z,Great location and adorable house. 
1525686,41116717,2017-04-05T23:15:34Z,This was a mostly pleasant stay. The house is listed at 700 but the cottage in the back is 702 so it is a little confusing for me and my guests to find. The hosts sent an angry text message when my friend could not find the actual building which wasn't very clearly described. Having the proper until number will really help. These hosts were sticklers for details which made me feel a bit unwelcome and the shower was a bit difficult to maneuver. 
1525686,71939704,2017-04-04T17:24:54Z,"Stop looking for a place to stay; you have found it. George and Thea's place is within walking distance to everything Venice Beach. And your hosts have thought of everything.  This is a perfect place for the girls' weekend, a romantic get-away, or simply an escape from your real life. Not only is the place secluded, but it is fabulously decorated and equipped so that you can kick back and relax while in beautiful Venice beach. "
1525686,11804668,2017-04-01T15:56:49Z,"Small, cute guesthouse cottage in the backyard. We were able to walk (10-15 minutes) to cute shops and eats on Abbot Kinney. Quiet little getaway."
1525686,9290311,2017-03-26T15:13:41Z,"Cute, simple cottage in a quiet neighborhood really close to lots of shopping! We enjoyed our stay, beds were comfortable and neighborhood was quiet at night. No AC, but we were gone most of the days and it cooled off at night. Thea also brought me a fan which helped a lot!"
1525686,2411895,2017-03-22T16:56:45Z,George and Thea's place was great. The place has everything you need and a quirky but nice style. Thea was great. She helped us on arrival and sent us to a nice coffee shop in walking distance. This was a stopover between New Zealand and home. Comfortable bed. Highly recommended. 
1525686,61884142,2017-03-21T16:08:02Z,"Great space. Great location. Quiet tucked away cottage in walking and biking distance to everything. Helpful, communicative hosts. Best guestbook concept ever. Will definitely stay in the sweetest cottage again. So happy to have discovered it. "
1525686,63548775,2017-03-15T17:17:46Z,George and Thea's place is in a great place.  It is in a quiet residential area but not far from fun and adventure in Venice and LA.  The place is clean and comfortable and I would gladly stay again.
1525686,27860473,2017-03-13T15:18:14Z,"This place was great and definitely had a Venice feel from the bright decorations to the lemon tree in the yard. Clean, cute, and within walking/biking distance to the beach and shops on Abbot Kinney. A great little weekend get away. "
1525686,1537779,2017-03-10T18:12:35Z,"George and Thea's place is really nice. Clean and breezy. I arrived in the evening after work, walked to Abbot Kinney to find a place to eat dinner- everything is pretty close. Wish I'd been able to stay longer. "
1525686,39514262,2017-03-09T19:18:38Z,"I had a quick overnight trip come up suddenly and George and Thea's bungalow was available nearby.  My daughter and I found it a perfect, quiet location but close by to shops and dining. Recommended."
501171,8201132,2017-05-06T10:52:16Z,"The location is very special on the top of the station! But without any disturbance from it.
The appartment is very well appointed with anything one could possibly need.
We stayed for two weeks, and we plan to return later in the year.
Our host, Peter, was very helpful in every way."
501171,2988293,2017-04-12T09:08:18Z,We had a great time in the clock tower. The location is very central and we had immediate access to the underground and also the eurostar. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean. The kitchen was also useful but most of the time we ate outside on our way through London. Peter was not there when we arrived but the check-in was easy and we got our keys from the concierge. Peter was a friendly and welcoming host who always tried to help and support us in different ways - when he was there. But he was very busy and always on the run. It was a nice experience to stay there and definitely a good location to stay if you want to explore the city and if you are bored with hotel rooms. 
501171,89920159,2017-04-09T09:53:00Z,"Great place - very central with easy access to the tube in zone one.  Peter is a very nice gentleman and a wonderful host.  Make sure if there are more than two staying on your visit that you clarify in advance what your sleeping arrangements are; we had three in one room but had thought that the landing futon would have been made available to us, but were wrong.  Also - you can hear the tube trains running during the evening, so if you turn in by 10 or 11 and are a light sleeper, the noise might be an issue.  Not sure if or when the trains stop running - I always fell asleep acceptably... "
501171,41934275,2017-04-06T08:31:25Z,"My parents stayed at the Clock Tower and had a great time. Wonderful location and amazing views. Peter was also a great host, letting my parents drop their bags off before check in. Peter was easy to communicate with too. Great experience!! "
501171,1739938,2017-04-05T07:41:05Z,"This is such a special experience. The views, the thrill of being in the St Pancras clock tower did not disappoint. Everything is beautifully arranged and all amenities provided and Peter is a welcoming host, keen to make sure everything works well. Fantastic links into central London too for theatre, exhibitions etc. Perfect for a special break."
501171,9030021,2017-04-02T09:07:42Z,The most central location you could ask for. A beautiful building. Gothic revival at it's finest. 
501171,101505936,2017-03-30T07:34:56Z,"This was a short holiday for my wife, daughter (4) and myself. 
We had a great time. Super friendly and accommodating hosts. We wanted to arrive a little early, no bother to them and keys were left at the concierge desk just in case, but they were also there to greet us. (The lads at the concierge desk were also gents)
The place was very clean and had rather well stocked cupboards. Little bottles of wine, biscuits, tea and coffee… all you’d expect and a lot more (and all well in date). Never got to fire up the stereo system, but they have Rogers Export Monitors [BBC LS3/6 “ish”]. Broke my heart as I was trying to wangle a Harbeth Super 5 audition while I was there, alas – not possible with a 4 year old, probably for the best with my skinny wallet.
We really had a ball and the place is obviously epic on a grander than grand scale. Location couldn’t be better… 20 mins walk to a decent Harbeth dealer (kidding. But it is). 2 mins walk to the British library (Daughter announced after 5 minutes “this is boring”). Thankfully the 7 stories high Hamleys toy store is 10 bucks away in a London cab. British museum is about the same distance (****ing amazing museum of a life time – allow 2+ days to do it properly). We also did London zoo, not as polished as Dublin zoo, but you can’t beat a live butterfly tunnel, walk in spider enclosure and a merry go round! (although 80 bucks in and the total day stung me for circa £140!).
Tips: down stairs there are 2 M&S’s a biggy and a small one. If you’ve a nipper, McDonalds is within sight of the apartment . Out the main door to the right about 20 yards is a half decent Pizza Express. Irish pub across the road. The square in front seems to have what looks like a cracking food market (mid week).
Summary – Amazing!
"
501171,18700214,2017-03-28T09:35:07Z,"When I was planning my trip for my daughter and me I wanted to find a unique space that was well situated in town.  When I found Peter's listing it seemed to fit the bill so we made the proper arrangements.  My decision could not have been better.  Peter was a gracious, friendly, and accommodating host that made sure we had everything that we needed.  There were a few events taking place in the tower while we were there but we hardly noticed and were given a heads up prior to arrival.  The location at Kings Cross was wonderful for travel around the city both walking and underground.  Peter's restaurant recommendations were very nice as we especially enjoyed the desert at Carluccio's down in St. Pancras.  I will recommend this apartment to anyone traveling to London that is looking for something a bit different and special.  Thanks again to Peter for being such a great host."
501171,11852307,2017-03-24T09:13:40Z,St. Pancras clock tower is the perfect place to stay when visiting London. 
501171,74105937,2017-03-21T09:49:06Z,"The tower is amazing place and Peter is a great host. When we arrived, everything was ready for us. The location is perfect, the view is amazing and there is even a piano if you have someone to play it with you. I can definitely recommend anyone staying there and would like to return myself some time again."
501171,16590588,2017-03-18T08:44:08Z,Wonderful opportunity to be part of iconic setting and flat

501171,114682491,2017-03-06T08:17:03Z,Absolutely fantastic place to stay if you need a great central accommodation with amazing views and to stay somewhere with so much character! We will definitely not be returning as our room we had was a far better then what we were expecting .. great communication from the host and brilliant facilities. We really enjoyed staying here one of the best hotel rooms we have ever had thankyou x 
501171,92654178,2017-03-06T04:51:59Z,An amazing experience in a spacious room that's more like a studio.
501171,6420350,2017-03-03T11:44:25Z,"The clock tower is amazing! The location is so convenient, with access to both St. Pancras and Kings Cross. The entire apartment building is gorgeous- details and history. The guest suite is nice with its own bathroom and kitchen. Peter is very accommodating allowing us to drop our bags off early and late. It was very nice having our morning coffee with him. He is very nice and so helpful with our tube transportation. Highly recommend, if you have the budget for it. "
501171,31062577,2017-03-02T06:43:09Z,"Pete and Tim's home is one of a kind - literally! Fantastic location close to transport, wonderful views over Kings Cross, and warm and welcoming hosts! The clocktower / lounge area is a great space to chill out in, although it is rarely unused! Overall a wonderful memorable stay and will certainly look to book again if we're back in London. Do be forewarned to book early!!"
501171,98822955,2017-02-21T11:09:30Z,Novelty accommodation in a central location - a super experience.
501171,2310621,2017-02-16T10:30:50Z,"The flat is unlike any other Airbnb I've stayed in. Where else can one spend a night in a clocktower? 

The flat is close to many amenities. It is a quiet flat with all of the comforts of home. 

Lastly, Pete is an attentive and cheerful host. It was a fantastic experience. "
501171,29698855,2017-02-15T10:47:17Z,Amazing space in an amazing building within an amazing city. A truly exceptional apartment perfectly situated to experience the best London has to offer.
534650,95897571,2017-04-27T12:17:04Z," Merci pour votre aimable accueil , nous avons passé un excellent séjour "
534650,5427002,2017-04-26T09:49:07Z,"
Der Kontakt mit Gilian war freundlich, alle nötigen Infos vorhanden, das kleine Haus schön und zweckmäßig eingerichtet. Das WLAN hat bei uns hat nicht funktioniert. Da die Wohnung im Hinterhof liegt war es sehr ruhig.  Alles in allen eher teuer für eine Familie, aber ich denke es ist normal für diese Frühlingszeit in Paris. Die Lage in Paris ist allerdings sehr gut, auch die Erreichbarkeit mit der RER vom Flughafen her ist gut. 

Nochmals Danke dir Gilian für den frühen check-in time und für die Aufbewahrung unsere Gepäcke. Das schätzen wir sehr.

"
534650,116744735,2017-04-21T09:04:44Z,Very pleasant stay
534650,66494881,2017-04-13T07:30:17Z,"El departamento está muy bien ubicado y está todo muy limpio, tienes  todos los servicios como decimos en México  a tiro de piedra solo cambiaría el sofá individual por uno más cómodo y quedamos invitados volver a tu  departamento 
Saludos
Aquiles  "
534650,47516537,2017-04-10T06:04:20Z,"Gilian's loft is a great lodging in Paris: it is clean, safe, quiet, near a metro stop, has lots of character, has all the necessities supplied , and Gilian was easy to communicate with.  NB: It is a small space and really wouldn't accommodate 5; there are 3 beds, not 4- two singles and one queen. We had 3 people and it was fine. "
534650,90593637,2017-04-05T09:13:51Z,"Posizione perfetta per raggiungere i luoghi principali e vari negozi. Check-in e check-out semplice e veloce. La casa va bene per 4 persone, era ordinata e pulita e inoltre l'ambiente è molto caratteristico. Ci siamo trovati molto bene, da ritornarci."
534650,29341134,2017-03-27T07:18:57Z,very nice place to stay in Paris. 
534650,20863365,2017-03-24T09:48:40Z,"Loved Gilian's apartment! So cozy, quaint, and after a long day of walking around it was the perfect place to wind down. The home is tucked in a courtyard, so it's quiet but in a lively area. The door is challenging and took us a couple minutes each time that we came and went, but loved the place and would come back!!"
534650,51283936,2017-03-05T07:50:20Z,"It's a very nice trip here, and the house is grate comfortable ~ it's clean clair calm, and there are some supermarket around for buying the things we need. Wifi works very well, the space inside the house is totally enough for 2 persons with more than 3 big suitcases. We cooked our breakfasts here every morning, all tools here. The bathroom is clean too. Best wishes and good trip."
534650,44408530,2017-02-22T09:32:48Z,Well located in a central neighborhood and super functional apartment. Reasonably fair pricing despite high cleaning fee. 
534650,109950483,2017-02-18T08:15:00Z,"The best place yo stay in París. Just like that.
Great price and amazing location."
534650,88917302,2017-02-14T09:52:13Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Gilian's place. Gilian was very helpful and efficient prior to arriving. He was also there ready to welcome us on arrival. Gilian's place is lovely, with lots of character and all the amenities you could wish for. The location was convenient as it was walking distance from Gare de Nord (Eurostar). We also manage to walk to a couple of the fantastic landmarks Paris has to offer. In conclusion, Gilian's place is well located, comfortable and beautifully Parisian."
534650,97320996,2017-02-13T07:39:55Z,Gilian' place was clean and central. Close to public transport and very walkable. Would definitely stay again 
534650,39971514,2017-02-05T09:29:57Z,Great apartment which is walking distance from the hotspots. Easy to find and walk to from the station. Would recommend!

534650,42568988,2017-01-15T10:29:26Z,"Great location with easy access to the transport stations, cafes and restaurants. Haven't met Gilian in person but his instructions were easy to understand."
534650,35433675,2017-01-09T09:00:32Z,"Just wonderful. Gilian was there to greet me and give me the run down of the place. The house was just magical, I could only dream of living in a place like that. How lucky you are Gilian! Would love to stay here again."
534650,104695297,2016-12-30T07:55:13Z,The location was great and house was nice. This house was very warm and cozy.  
1352131,7904003,2017-05-07T16:13:27Z,"Great communication, lovely apartment close to everything I needed to do in LA. Great value. Would stay here again!"
1352131,3084625,2017-05-03T17:15:42Z,Unbelievable location in LA - yet you feel like the ambiance of Paris.  Pitch perfect!
1352131,1328229,2017-05-02T16:10:29Z,"Collette's place is great!
Collett herself is lovely and easy to communicate with. Check in was a breeze and she made sure we knew about what was happening in the city so we could plan around it.
The place is perfect. Plenty of space, beautifully decorated, wonderful comfortable bed, lovely bathroom, big windows with dark curtains to shut ouy any street light at night.
We were in downtown to go to the convention centre which was only a 20 minute walk or a $6 Uber if you're tired from the night before like us.
From this location using public transport we also went to WeHo, LACMA, walked up to The Broad. 
Collette mentioned there might be some noise at night, but we sincerely didn't hear a thing and slept comfortably. 
We also felt safe walking around late at night.
Thank you Collette!"
1352131,5373343,2017-04-28T18:26:14Z,The place is very well maintained and I would recommend it to anyone visiting LA. Colette was very helpful for our emergency request to print out last minute tickets.
1352131,73872932,2017-04-25T16:46:34Z,"Such a cute little loft in the middle of downtown! Close to all the cool restaurants and shops. Colette was the sweetest, and so easy to talk too. Parking is available as well, which makes it easier to leave whenever you please. Overall, amazing experience!"
1352131,119772459,2017-04-23T18:44:09Z,"This place is truly a hidden gem. Nothing quite like it. If you want an authentic LA experience, this is the place. You can walk everywhere, and it feels like home. Colette makes the place look and feel like such an awesome hotel. It is worth every penny. "
1352131,75264517,2017-04-21T18:26:52Z,"This space is so fabulous. Colette went the extra mile to make sure we had a comfortable stay. She has everything you would need or desire in her apartment! Coffee, tea, biscotti, oatmeal, water in the fridge, soap and shampoo in the bathroom. Really, we didn't want for a thing!  The tv has cable and Netflix all set up for us to use.  And free parking at the lot 1 block away. We had so much fun exploring and photographing DTLA. We ate at some great local restaurants, Grand Central Market, and shopping at the jewelry mart is just a few blocks away. Thanks for a great week. Hope to be back soon!"
1352131,18950787,2017-04-16T18:56:45Z,This room is extremely beautiful. And Colette is a really friendly person. I would recommend this place to anybody else
1352131,63247627,2017-04-15T16:19:18Z,Do yourself a favor and stop looking for somewhere now! Pick Colette's place! You will be happy you did! She is amazing and the place is even better than pictured! Loved every single thing about my stay!
1352131,122241062,2017-04-14T16:49:03Z,"Such a unique place! Very clean, open, and convenient to many shops, attractions, and food! The Paris theme was wonderfully conveyed and very artistic. Would stay again!"
1352131,27567074,2017-04-13T18:45:59Z,Everything is as described. Colette is a great host.
1352131,32904520,2017-04-10T17:30:12Z,"Colette's place was beautiful and looked exactly like the pictures.  The decorations were very unique, and it was clean when we arrived.  Colette was easy to communicate with before and during our stay."
1352131,119346977,2017-04-09T15:21:51Z,Definitely would book this place again a little rowdy at night but it's downtown LA so nothing new it's close to everything food staple center and shopping boutiques also Colette was super helpful in every aspect she really knows how to treat her guests ;) if you like Art you will definitely like her library collection !
1352131,4497166,2017-04-03T16:34:38Z,"I loved everything about this space. I stay here to write and to decompress on visits alone. It is inspiring and peaceful, regardless of being downtown. It equipped with everything you need and Colette is always available to answer any questions or bring anything you need. A true gem."
1352131,47183496,2017-04-01T16:13:08Z,"Colette has made a wonderful getaway in the heart of L.A. If you don't mind a decent walk, it's a 30min walk to Staples Center. 10 mins to Grand Central Market. We loved the little Paris theme, the furniture was spectacularly chosen. Comfortable and homey. Would definitely stay again. "
1352131,12436137,2017-03-31T17:57:22Z,"Very communicative and easy check in! Would stay again, especially for the price. "
1352131,1867745,2017-03-30T16:47:40Z,"Truly a home away from home! Fantastic place every little thing thought of. Collette is a dream to deal with and was extremely helpful and great to communicate with. Only wish I was staying longer. Would never consider staying anywhere else when in LA. 
"
1352131,112617638,2017-03-28T15:22:47Z,"Colette's place in Los Angeles will make you feel like it's your home away from home. The decor was true to the pictures and beautiful!! It was a Perfect first Airbnb experience for me, and staying there made my first trip to Los Angeles most memorable. Colette was a fantastic hostess, very personable, available and knowledgeable about everything! Do not hesitate to book Colette's place!! I will definitely return soon!!
"
1352131,86954661,2017-03-19T17:40:47Z,"What a charming French chic place! Extra clean, attention to detail, an absolute delight to stay (URL HIDDEN) was hard to leave the room......gorgeous! Cool neighborhood with tons of food options nearby. Colette is a sweet person who was a gracious host. We so appreciated our stay! "
1352131,116259356,2017-03-17T18:16:45Z,I enjoyed the place and it was very cute. The area downtown is a little noisy but not too bad. Colette was super nice and communication was great.

9301500,82004782,2017-05-03T07:31:55Z,"设计感很好,很温馨,下次还会来。"
9301500,124194668,2017-05-01T06:42:50Z,"出门步行五六分钟就是地铁站,上海传统弄堂里也很安静。屋里设施也很一应俱全,wifi速度也不慢。房东小姐姐态度很好声音也很好听。临退房的时候因为赶时间中断了洗衣机的烘干,结果洗衣机门就因为安全锁打不开了!很无奈只得等它重新烘干结束再把衣服快递过来......幸好房东姐姐很耐心地给了解决办法,虽然加收的服务费是有点小贵啦(笑)最后就是蚊虫问题,第二天起床女票身上被咬了好多小包,也不知道是蚊子还是床上的小虫,希望以后在夏天能准备点防虫措施吧,唯一的一点美中不足~"
9301500,117974572,2017-04-24T01:39:26Z,"这次回国有幸能入住沙漠星辰!因为屋主miumiu的独特品味,从airbnb上一众房子中被沙漠星辰所吸引,在无比畅通和高效的沟通下,顺利的预订了房间。
房间位于法租界,地理位置非常好。虽然藏在闹市中,但房间由于在里弄的里边,所以只听得到鸟叫,完全听不到车和噪音,这一点非常棒!
另外一点是,交通真的非常方便,附近有地铁二号线和地铁一号线和十号线,门口由于靠近商业街和酒吧区,所以出租车也很多;另外,门口还有共享单车,可以租上一辆自行车骑行在法租界,体检最精华最美的上海,不失为体检上海的最佳方式。
miumiu人超nice,很体贴的准备了入住指南,很贴心。而且房间内部的装饰和图片一致,所住即所见,能住进这样一间用心布置的房间,让我的上海之行加分不少。 
房间亮点:1、床非常舒服,这几天觉都睡的不错。2、房间有带烘干的洗衣机,可以洗衣服,完了可以直接烘干。3、房间有很多好听的CD,早上泡上一杯咖啡听着美妙的音乐,开启美好一天。 "
9301500,117557346,2017-04-17T02:09:14Z,"还会回来,因为童年,因为梧桐;因为价值,因为房东,因为上海是家...."

9301500,99657925,2017-04-01T01:50:51Z,Miumiu's place is everything that was advertised. A very central location but also very quiet compared to other places in the same neighborhood.

我们十二点多就到了,清洁阿姨让我们把行李放下之后去吃了个饭,回来还没有到入住时间,但是我们可以进去化妆休整一下准备出门。房东很贴心,房间设置齐全,wifi电视空调音响都有,锅碗瓢盆一应俱全,柴米油盐也都准备。房东还贴心的准备了定型喷雾,在南方的潮湿季节刘海就不会塌掉啦!最细节的地方是烧热水的水壶,非常干净,让我们感到很放心。毛巾也很柔软。

4244165,67343909,2017-05-05T18:08:47Z,The place was really cool. It was right across the street from the river.  The owners are realy nice.  I recommend this place.  The only downside is you can hear everything.
4244165,120782893,2017-04-26T12:55:07Z,"Thane's place is a classic loft in the best sense of the word.  Because of the open space and wood floors, you will hear the neighbors on occasion, but I did not find it to be a problem.  The location is adjacent to RiverWalk and you can take a stroll along the river and be in downtown Detroit in under two miles.  It was the perfect experience start to finish and I highly recommend it.  Karen is personable, friendly and a wonderful host.
And hopefully I will have the opportunity to meet Thane on a future visit.  Would love to stay there again."
4244165,7569615,2017-04-17T15:31:18Z,The Loft is amazing. Really nice hosts they left everything we need for breakfast and some bikes. We had a really nice time.
4244165,3682415,2017-04-14T15:33:37Z,Thane place is amazing! The location is great and all the insights we got from him and Karen made our trip so special. We really feel we got the best and most real experience of the city!
4244165,24386671,2017-04-02T15:31:45Z,Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay on our trip to Detroit - the loft was exactly as shown and the building even more charming than we expected. Thane and his mother Karen were very accommodating and helpful during the entire stay. Highly recommend! 
4244165,47875320,2017-03-30T12:12:27Z,This place is awesome. Easily my favourite airbnb and i've stayed in a zillion of them. I felt bad for leaving karen a bunch of dishes because she's super cool. the airbnb was both quiet and flooded with light in the morning. I totally loved my stay and would recommend the space to anyone.
4244165,114028002,2017-03-27T12:13:12Z,It was perfect!!
4244165,9573897,2017-03-24T14:11:08Z,"Comfortable clean artsy loft with great windows, sun, views.  Karen and Thane are wonderful hosts.  "
4244165,2376754,2017-03-19T12:17:55Z,The location is great! The apartment is spacious and very charming. It was clean and had all the comforts of home. The recommendations were excellent and the communication was prompt and excellent. I really enjoyed my time in Detroit at Thane's place and look forward to a return visit. Many thanks especially to Karen!!!
4244165,68753091,2017-03-12T14:11:28Z,"Thane's apartment is just incredible! From the view of the river, to how the light hits through his apartment windows to his amazing (URL HIDDEN) just got better and better! The only thing that topped his amazing apartment was his mother Karen! She greeted us when we got there and showed us around and made sure we were all settled in before she was on her way! She was a blast and my boyfriend and I wish we could have hung out with Karen the whole weekend! Such beautiful and kind soul! They provided breakfast items in the fridge and said we could help ourselves to anything we wanted! The apartment was very clean and homey. We absolutely loved it and would definitely stay again the next time we are in town! 

Thank you Thane and Karen!"
4244165,34226004,2017-02-25T16:57:38Z,"Thane's place is amazing.  I lived in Detroit for a little over a year before relocating back to Washington, DC.  I decided to stay at Thane's place when I visited Detroit recently for a work event.  My only regret was that I couldn't stay longer! Karen welcomed me upon arrival.  She is super friendly, kind, and very attentive.  The place is as pictured but even better.  The decor is remarkable, and the artsy touches make the place really feel like home.  I had to work remotely for a few days, but I didn't have a problem at all.  Thane's place is definitely work-ready with a nice-sized desk and comfy desk-chair.  I will definitely stay here again. "
4244165,6873807,2017-02-12T17:54:01Z,"The loft is incredibly cool, and in a hip part of town for a great Detroit experience. It's such an interesting place to stay with lots of curiosities and personal touches. You won't get bored, and will be comfortable and about a 10 minute drive away from hundreds of interesting things to do. The block seemed perfectly safe, and there is a great view of the river. Thanks for a great stay! "
4244165,34755215,2017-02-06T13:25:59Z,"This was a same day/last minute booking and Thane was responded within minutes and began to get the place ready for us. Sadly, because of the timing of that night, I was not able to meet him but, he was very pleasant over the phone.

The place has a very classic feel to it with a great view of the River Walk and less than a 2 min walk to a 24hr Walgreens which came in handy various times. 

Wish it was warm enough to ride one of his bikes that he left there. Also, he left a partially stocked fridge with breakfast items and beer, which helped out in my case because I got in so late and didn't have time to pick anything up. 

Would love to stay there again during the summer to take advantage of the River Walk. 

He is a great host and especially knows what he is doing as far as setting a good overall ambience in his condo. Highly recommended!"
4244165,10795534,2017-01-29T13:04:35Z,"Thane and Karen were great, and the place is even more beautiful in person than the photos! Very modern, chic, and comfortable. The location is 5-10 minutes from all the Detroit hot spots, and in a very safe location. I only wish we had gone during warmer weather so we could take advantage of walking by the water! Very great spot, would recommend to anyone visiting Detroit for any reason :-)"
4244165,38440774,2017-01-15T14:53:10Z,"Our stay with Thane and Karen was great. Checking in and out was simple, and nearly everywhere was walking distance or a $6 Uber/Lyft. Our first night the upstairs neighbors were loud late into the night and we were unable to get them to keep it down a bit. It was more of an issue for my girlfriend, but neither of us were too upset. Loud neighbors happen sometimes and it was nothing Thane or Karen could have really done much about.

The apartment is built from an old warehouse or factory, so it's a bit drafty and the heater kicked on frequently to fight the cold, so it still managed to be toasty for our winter stay.

Overall, it was great and my girlfriend and I had a lot of fun. We would use Thane's place again without hesitation."
4244165,2918174,2017-01-11T13:44:08Z,Great place to experience Detroit's loft livestyle. Karen was great introducing me to the unit. Will defenetly be back!
4244165,108294647,2017-01-08T15:32:57Z,"I loved my stay here! They were so welcoming and made sure I had a good experience. Since it was so cold I loved staying at the loft. I would definitely stay here again. The only thing is the thin walls and the people above, but that's nothing they can control. "
4244165,16748248,2017-01-04T14:54:24Z,"We had an awesome time at Thane's! Karen and he were fantastic hosts, met us on arrival, and took great care! We would recommend this place to anyone, great views of the river and a quick ride to downtown nightlife. The loft was roomy and felt like home. Thanks!!!"
4244165,106555101,2017-01-02T14:10:44Z,"Thane's Artsy River Loft is definitely as advertised.  The view from this north-east corner unit has a great view of the Detroit River and Belle Isle.  Situated in a converted factory, this place certainly held a great deal of old world charm while being clean and filled with modern amenities that we're used to.  The location on the waterfront makes it ideal for walks or a bike ride on newly updated pathways during the day.  Otherwise, it's a straight shot down Jefferson Ave into downtown.  Finally, between Thane's guide to exploring Detroit and Karen's great ability to look after us during our stay, we had the best service anyone could ask for."
4244165,15876201,2016-12-31T16:54:07Z,Karen and Thane have it dialed in making the stay easy.  Loved having the tips on eats and city highlights.  The location is great for city adventuring.  
348991,24250548,2017-04-20T01:42:55Z,This is 2nd time to stay at Genie's Hanok. Genie is very helpful and fast response as usual. The Hanok is cozy & good location. Nice place!
348991,24344537,2017-04-09T02:30:46Z,"Genie is a great host - very responsive and taking great care in the preparation. Apartment has everything you need a including T-money cards and a portable Wifi (big plus !). Location is 10min walk to subway and walking distance to the palace. Bars, coffee shops etc. all in walking distance - try the BBQ chicken place across jahamun road - great also for take-away and eating in the little ""courtyard"". Sleeping on the floor was more comfortable than expected - a true ""traditional"" experience ! Can definitely recommend to stay there ! "
348991,37923501,2017-03-13T23:42:34Z,"Three of us girls stayed at Genie's house for 9 days. The location is excellent, quiet with great Gingshen soup restaurant need by. We took cabs most of the time to go to busy shopping areas. Coming from US, we did not have experience sleeping on the heated floor but it was very comfortable and good for your back. We also had to get used to using the shower. Overall, it was a great cultural experience, much better than staying in a hotel. Genie is also super responsive. Love to come back again! "
348991,44459010,2017-03-04T00:54:04Z,"Genie is amazing! She booked us taxi to pick us up from the airport, welcomed us warmly when we arrived (she even gave us three umbrellas when she noticed that it's raining in Seoul) and gave us the best help for us to get around (since we don't speak Korean). Her place is very cool, too! Floor heating is amazing and living in her Hanok is such a cool experience, especially for my grandparents. Definitely recommended!!"
348991,111520399,2017-02-05T00:37:20Z,非常赞的房子。房东很热亲。房子很干净
348991,84408018,2017-02-01T00:47:57Z,"这次的旅行我们很满意,因为住行方面是很大一个原因。谢谢房东的贴心,给我们接机,还在我们搬到第二个家的时候还帮我们和司机协调提前送我们去机场,谢谢房东的热心帮忙。房子也很舒适,最让我们惊喜的是连洗手间都有地热,真的太舒服了。如果下回去,我们还会选择这家的。"
348991,100184979,2017-01-25T01:29:13Z,"有韩屋特色,第一次睡地铺很特别,虽然户外是零下的温度,不过有地暖加持,睡觉倒也暖和!房间卫生间等面积较小,不算高档,但也经济舒适!空调不知道是不是我们不会用,始终不出暖风,就放弃使用了!地暖的温度也基本够暖和!
出门交通还是挺便利的,走路10分钟左右就有地铁,周边咖啡馆小吃店也很多,不用担心早餐没地方吃!"
348991,101629378,2017-01-11T23:11:13Z,It's comfortable and convenient. Systems in hanok is perfect. Genie also gives the information about the neighborhood and the restaurant. Gyeongbokgung is close to the hanok too. We are satisfied with the hanok.
348991,62484891,2016-12-24T23:45:36Z,"交通方便,房东非常好,能很好体验当地居民住房,非常有特色,非常干净舒适,准备的物品贴心实用。强烈推荐,下次来韩国还要住这家!"
348991,43838722,2016-12-20T23:35:02Z,性價比高
348991,103535953,2016-12-11T00:11:00Z,"韩屋的体验很特别,不过南方人睡地暖始终有些不适应,感觉容易上火。还好每天早晚灌两大杯水,没上火,房屋温度要设置好,不然太冷太热都不行。总体还是相当不错,房东回复问题特别及时,必须给房东的热情点个赞。还发图片标记帮助我们找水果店,附近就有个711便利店很方便,离明洞打车30RMB,赞。感觉天气暖和一点去韩国旅游更棒,这次去韩国还是太冷了,出入不方便。"
348991,83621159,2016-10-22T00:37:20Z,"My family and I stayed at this traditional hanok house for 6 days.  The location was fantastic, we could walk to many attractions and restaurants.  The home was very clean and cozy.  We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hanok home."
348991,13738015,2016-10-17T03:43:02Z,"This was the second time we stayed at Genie's home. Checking in was easy, and the key card could also be used for the subway, which was convenient. Her home was immaculate, and the instructions for everything were very clear. We used the portable Wi-Fi device when we traveled around Seoul and beyond. The neighborhood is in a great location, with close proximity to shops, restaurants, attractions, and hiking. We also like the location because you can walk to several different areas, e.g., Bukchon and Insadong. We had a great stay and would definitely recommend Genie's hospitality to anyone visiting Seoul."
348991,18907781,2016-10-03T00:36:38Z,Very good house and very nice Genie. The house is near 青瓦台 and walk to sub-way station for less 10mins. We have very good experience for staying here which definitely different from hotel. And Genie is so kind to wait us in the 1st day due to delayed flight. And also remind us the umbrella when someday is rainy.
348991,67880341,2016-08-19T10:07:55Z,"韩屋干净舒适,离地铁也不远,出行方便。厨房虽小,但是一应俱全,可以做简单早餐,很方便。两个卫生间不大,很干净,适合四个人居住。虽然不像住酒店有人天天来打扫,但是自己每天做简单清扫垃圾分类也很方便。非常美好的住宿体验,让我们度过了一个愉快假期。

The house is clean and comfortable, location is not far from the metro. The kitchen is not very big, but the facilities are convenient to do simple breakfast. Two small bathrooms are also clean, good enough for four persons to stay. We have a very pleasant holiday, thanks."
348991,18004884,2016-08-13T00:51:30Z,"Nous avons passé une très bonne semaine dans ce 'Hanok' traditionnnel, dans ce quartier animé (pleins de restaurants , de cafés) proche du palais présidentiel. Pour ceux qui sont à la recherche d'un Seoul authentique avec le charme d'antan, cette maison est parfaite! Il faut alors aller au bout de l'expérience et choisir de dormir sur les futons :)
Le logement est très bien équipé pour trois ou quatre personnes, il y a quand même deux salles d'eau/toilettes. Genie laisse à disposition tout ce qu'il faut: guides, dépliants, wifi portable, les cartes de transports à recharger ce qui facilite grandement le séjour. 
La communication avec Genie est très facile , son guide en ligne est très complet. "
348991,33436064,2016-07-18T02:19:59Z,"房间:非常好的韩屋体验,跟母亲两个人入住,非常方便,房间很干净,两个卫生间更是不可多得,几乎没有找到有两个卫生间的韩屋,总体面积虽小,但该有的都有。
出行:Genie的门卡可以直接当地铁卡使用 非常方便,还提供了wifi egg给住客,真的很感谢。
周边:房间离地铁站稍微有点距离 但也不远,走出去就有公交站,离青瓦台,光化门,景福宫,清溪川等都很近,可步行前往。

大家可能需要多注意一下垃圾分类和及时关热水,在Genie的house manual上有标明每天天黑后可以将垃圾放去的位置,由于没有看到,走的那天在院子里面放了4袋垃圾,真的很抱歉。

Genie's Hanok is really great, modern, quiet, clean and comfortable, you'll find everything you need in this house. me and my mum spent 4 nights there, great experiece and it's really rare to find a Hanok with 2 bathrooms.
Location: the nearest underground station needs about 7-10 mins walk, but you can find a bus station very close to the hanok. Genie's door key can be also used as a transportation card. beside, a wifi-egg is provided for all travellers, very considerate.

About garbage, please check the house manual first, Genie has pointed out the place where we can throw garbage everyday evening. unfortunately, i didnt see it and left 4 bags of garbage in the yard, feel really sorry about this."
348991,64688173,2016-06-29T07:45:31Z,"This is the perfect place for people who wants to explore Seoul/ Korean culture. The Blue house just next to this place. If the taxi driver don't know the destination in English, you can just say Cheong Wa Dae instead of the address. And there is a traditional Korean market near by. We finished our breakfast over there every morning. Anyway, I really like here! With personal highly recommend, this is place will be the one you are really looking for in Seoul, Korea:)"
348991,19204443,2016-06-17T02:25:27Z,"Genie was a great host! Very accommodating especially in terms of our check-in and check-out schedule. Her home was not only well-equipped but also very beautiful. The neighbourhood has many amenities such as bakeries, coffee houses, convenience stores and is very safe due to its proximity to the Blue House. All in all, a wonderful experience. "
348991,46335117,2016-06-13T03:47:17Z,"非常棒的一套房子,传统韩屋,但是装修精致设备先进,房间每一个地方都很干净,冬天的话还有地暖…有两个卫生间一家人入住非常的方便…地段就在景福宫西面…去青瓦台景福宫步行即可,出门3分钟内前后有很多公交车站,去任何地方的直达公交车都有,我们入住五天基本都是公交出行。有名的土俗村参鸡汤和皇后参鸡汤就在附近几个红绿灯外,还有个传统的市场在附近。入住那天房东姐姐帮我们介绍屋子的各个角落。房东也会有很多建议,可以帮我们代订出租车去机场。很好的体验!"
157129,67887854,2017-04-27T02:22:48Z,"Alfie and Kenji are hospitable.  The apartment is very clean and comfortable with tasteful minimal decor. Alfie's description on the apartment location is precisely to the dot; one does not need taxi to get to the apartment and can simply follow his instruction. 

The review by the other guests is also completely accurate.  "
157129,5617104,2017-04-23T02:07:32Z,"Alfie's place was spotless as it was shown in pictures. Didn't get a chance to talk to him enough but he was kind and friendly. The logic was perfect. It was very quiet and pretty neighborhood. I think, certainly for me, I felt a bit far from city center and tourist attractions, it wasn't a huge problem though. Highly recommended. "
157129,31044604,2017-04-07T02:34:46Z,"Overall it's ok, but does not quite meet our expectation. Most likely it's because the hostess is out of town and the host is very busy with his work. For example, we went to the house by taking a taxi in the evening. But, somehow the taxi driver entered the address wrong and took us to a wrong place. Since the driver does not speak English, we had a hard time to convince him that he entered a wrong address into his GPS. Worse, the host cannot answer our phone during that time to help us. It took us about half an hour more than usual to get to the house. it's really uneasy for tourists like us to went through this kind of journey in a place you visited for the first time. "
157129,11284742,2017-04-03T02:00:09Z,Lovely appartment in a nice residential location. Easily accessible by Subway with great transport links. Alfie and Kenji offered superb hospitality and ensured we had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. Would highly recommend staying here.
157129,45791448,2017-03-19T23:25:08Z,"It has been a pleasant experience to be at Kenji & Alfie's place. They respond very quickly and accurately, very helpful and sweet. I was with my 8-year old daughter, felt like home. The location is very convenient, some minutes to metro station. I will definitely come back again. "
157129,107683927,2017-03-16T02:33:04Z,Great experience  overall.  They are just great host. Everything  on point. I will totally  stay  again in the future. Had the privilege  to spent a little  time  with them. I totally recommend them
157129,105058793,2017-03-11T02:59:32Z,Very good-located apartment and there is 7-11 and familymart nearby so it's really very convenient. Well-prepared breakfast everyday as well as coffee machine available. We enjoy our trip very much.
157129,34873137,2017-03-04T02:24:39Z,"Alfie's place is a great place to stay if you're in Tokyo. The location is on a quiet street not far from shops, restaurants, and the metro. Alfie and Kenji were friendly and easy going. It is nicely decorated townhome with modern decor.  I definitely recommend."
157129,102534204,2017-02-15T03:08:15Z,"Alfie人很好的,热情好客,只是地方对于我们拖着四个大箱子的人离JR线有点远,很安静的住宅,谢谢丰富的早餐款待。"
157129,37509954,2017-02-10T00:45:55Z,"This was our second time staying at Alfie & Kenji's place and it was nothing but wonderful. There are never any issues with check in/out, and the place itself is perfect. They always have great recommendations for eating areas around Kanamecho Station, so my boyfriend and I always make it a point to go one before our stay us up. Highly, highly, highly, recommend this place to all! "
157129,38028403,2017-02-02T23:54:25Z,"原本两个女生住有点担心,没想到根本没觉得一点不便,房东虽然一起住,但总是很贴心错开时间,不会打扰。房屋位置离要町站近,门口有一个很大的711,很方便。"
157129,14455530,2017-01-30T01:05:37Z,"It's really pleasant to stay in such a nice place in Tokyo. Alfie was very helpful by answering all the questions we needed to know, and the place  was tidy and easy to find. We really appreciate the light breakfast and all the clear instructions about the house."
157129,10983591,2017-01-09T01:06:44Z,Alfie and Kenji have a lovely house and they are a really good host. The replies were always prompt. The room is exactly looked the same as the picture. It was a pity that I haven't got the chance to meet them. Highly recommended to other Airbnb users to stay in their house. 
157129,24565289,2016-12-06T01:10:26Z,"Will definitely book this place again in the the future and recommend it to my friends and relatives. Very clean, orderly and excellent location. "
157129,71904299,2016-12-02T03:06:30Z,"Alfie and Kenji's place was great. It was close to a local subway station which was then close to the Yamanote line. There were plenty of restaurants, convenience stores and shops in the area. 

Both Alfie and Kenji were efficient with communication and my partner and I loved chatting to the both of them when we met them. 

The pictures are exactly what you get (or better) and everything is very clean, it's spotless. 

There was fresh breakfast food everyday and a coffee machine to use which was perfect for breakfast before exploring. 

The bathroom is large and has a good shower. There are towels in the room for use as well which was great since I forgot mine. 

The bedroom itself on the first floor is spacious, it has a heater/air-con and the bed was very comfortable. They also provide some brochures/maps of things to do in Tokyo which was lovely. 

The downstairs toilet which is for guest usage was like most other Japanese toilets with a warm toilet seat which was great. 

My partner and I highly recommend the Urban Tokyo House to anyone looking for comfort and quiet but still close to the city to explore. Also the place was easy to find and access and since the room was on the first floor there are no hassles of having to carry heavy luggage upstairs. 

Also I lost my phone in Japan and I messaged Alfie and he was kind enough to look for me at the local station, so he is definitely a host that is nice and likes to put in the extra effort. "
157129,51204174,2016-11-26T03:56:10Z,"Hi Alfie, Kenji,

Sorry we missed seeing you on our last day! Just wanted to say thank you very much for your generous hospitality and making it such a pleasant stay for us in Japan! 

We enjoyed every part of our stay in Tokyo from the cleanliness of your facilities to the comfort, contemporary decor, pastries and fruit provided. It was a great pleasure and fun that we were able to enjoy dinner with you at the local restaurant on our last night in Tokyo! 

Thank you, we are very grateful for all your advice/recommendations and would highly recommend your Airbnb accommodation to any of our friends and family! Btw the monorail to Haneda airport had great views and very fast!!! 

Sonya & Leigh"
157129,47689838,2016-11-09T02:56:56Z,The place was very clean and a short distance from the station. It is easy to find the place if you have pocket wifi and Alfie gave us very clear instructions and made sure that we had everything we needed. He always responded straightaway whenever we had questions and both him and Kenji were very accommodating and friendly. We would definitely stay with them again next time!
157129,66691995,2016-10-30T00:31:38Z,"Alfie and Kenji, it's really great knowing you guys. Their house is really very clean and tidy. Even the location is pretty good, going towards any location is just so convenient. They even prepared us with breakfast treats and coffee. Although we never spend much time with them because we had so much to explore in Tokyo, they even give tips on where to go and where to eat. They even recommend us in the neighboring area of what to eat and stuff. This 2 hosts are really friendly and sincere. I really wanna have my second trip to Japan and love staying with them. And yes of cause I won't forget that we spend some nights drinking and chatting together. It was so much fun having them giving us the best hospitality. Thank you guys. And really hope to see you guys soon."

Alfie and Kenji were great hosts and left us treats and coffee every morning for our trips into Tokyo as well!  Unfortunately we didn't get to spend much time with them as we were out adventuring a lot, but the night we did it was fabulous.

Recommended for sure.  Hope to return!"
157129,43234398,2016-10-07T02:47:31Z,"非常好的房子,温馨舒适而且干净漂亮!房东很好,每天提供丰富早餐(水果、咖啡、面包)。房子周围很安静,适合体验感受当地人的生活!距离要町站不远,交通方便!希望下次再预定!

Very good house, sweet and comfortable and clean and beautiful! The landlord is very good, every day provides a rich breakfast (fruit, coffee, bread). Around the house is very quiet, suitable for experience feelings of local people's life! Distance to town station, traffic is very convenient! I hope next time scheduled!"

3331121,7296803,2017-02-10T05:48:19Z,"Had a lovely short stay at this gorgeous heritage property, beautiful decoration, wonderful breakfast."
3331121,49533706,2017-01-27T06:16:26Z,its always a pleasure to stay with Bruce and Sonia.  My breakfast on the veranda is always good for the soul and the best bit of my day!  highly recommended!
3331121,45843868,2017-01-15T08:06:57Z,"From the beginning I do not know it's the place of the film ""the Constant Gardener"". I just like the historic style and the quiet place. Enjoy the garden and balcony breakfast with sunshine. Then I got this make me feel amazing and surprised. 
For the all, it's a really good place for living in a city. Relaxing and peaceful.
I recommend this place for your good holiday in Nairobi. "
3331121,7439463,2016-11-26T07:06:35Z,"Fabulous stay in a truly unique setting. Stepping back into history, hosted by great people. Would return anytime. "
3331121,79123,2016-11-15T08:38:26Z,Staying at Bruce's airbnb was a great experience. Sonia is a fabulous host and so kind and generous and such an amazing woman. The property is gorgeous and history of the house fantastic. The Village market is nearby and has great shops and restaurants. Great stay.
3331121,22999555,2016-11-06T08:46:59Z,"Though I was only there for a short while, I had a wonderful time. Sonia and Carles were so kind, the home is beautiful, the bed cozy, breakfast and coffee were super tasty, nice hot water shower and a great cab driver to boot. I look forward to staying here again :)"
3331121,40272535,2016-10-03T06:38:21Z,"Bruce is very helpful even before my arrival. I asked a lot questions on the logistic and local suggestion, he responded patiently. 
When i arrived, though bruce and sophia were not at home. But Charles(the cooker in the house) helped introduce the house, arrange the stuff and prepared yummy breakfast.!! Really a nice person. 
The surrounding of the house is really beautiful with quite& large garden. Also the building itself tells the history. Running at the Karura Forest (near the neighbourhood)  is what i enjoyed as well. I would like to stay in the house again when i m back to Nairobi.  "
3331121,2108022,2016-09-30T06:31:28Z,"My stay at the constant gardener was fantastic. The house is beautiful, quite, clean and tastefully furnished. Bruce and Sonia were extremely helpful in organizing and during my stay, as well as her staff. Having breakfast on the lovely veranda is an experience. Thank you - I will definitely stay here again... hopefully soon!"
3331121,41508375,2016-09-18T01:49:46Z,"I couldn't recommend Bruce's place enough!  His mother, Sonia, was there to welcome me and was extremely accommodating.  She went out of her way to make sure I had a great stay and made me feel like a local.  Bruce was very helpful in planning my trip and staying in Nairobi. 

The house itself is a little gem, within its own idyllic grounds in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Nairobi.  The local area feels very safe and is conveniently located.  A stay here is a must!"
3331121,43895484,2016-08-31T01:25:38Z,Another lovely stay. Somewhat annoying that the other guest insisted on quite audibly (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)ing on her veranda with California until 2am but highly recommended nonetheless. 
3331121,85820482,2016-08-15T08:39:25Z,"This was a wonderful place to stay, especially if you love to hear the amazing stories of a woman, Sonia Ryrie, who has lived in Kenya for 70 years.  A treat!"
3331121,21047391,2016-08-13T06:55:56Z,Lovely welcome by Sonia and all the friendly dogs. This was my second visit and I know I will stay here many more times!
3331121,49533706,2016-08-06T05:51:32Z,"again, another special stay........memorable evening of story-telling on the stoop with Sonia and another guest c/o Kenya Power"
3331121,74574180,2016-07-28T10:18:06Z,We had a very good contact by. Mail and phone before my Arrival. Although I had a very late Arrival (after 12 PM) Bruce was waiting at the Backyard to welkome me and offering a drink
3331121,33705145,2016-07-17T03:40:03Z,"My stay at the constant Gardner home was fantastic. The house is beautiful and Sonja and Bruce are extremely welcoming, accommodating and friendly. Since I had to work most of the time during my stay I unfortunately couldn't spend as much time at the house as I wanted. Nonetheless, perfect place for anyone looking for a beautiful calm oasis in bustling Nairobi."
3331121,1270413,2016-06-28T10:08:28Z,"I had a fantastic stay! The house is very quiet and calm and green and breathes history! Sonia (Bruce's mother) is a very charming lady who makes you feel very comfortable (she made me have tea and cake on the veranda every day :)) and has so many interesting stories about her life and the history of Kenya. I felt very welcome and secure at ""The Constant Gardener"" and will definitely come back."
13381106,50739983,2017-05-07T10:47:59Z,"What an original and tastefully decorated place, truly 1 of its kind! "
13381106,52205228,2017-04-30T07:40:49Z,"Very welcoming hosts, beautiful and peaceful setting. We definitely recommend the Brandy Bus for a chill out getaway, a quiet family/friends/couple time out of Nairobi or on the way to Kenyan national parks. A special thanks to Cathy and Charly, who were the perfect hosts in the absence of Karen."
13381106,11207570,2017-04-25T10:45:10Z,"The bus does not disappoint, very cool place and lov"
13381106,57850665,2017-04-24T06:46:12Z,A great quirky get away. Such fun for everyone. Location is quiet and fabulous to get away from the bustle of Nairobi. Suited us perfectly from our youngest (aged 10) to the oldest in our family (84!). Communication was great and prompt. Luxuries of flowers made it feel homely. Thanks for a great stay. 
13381106,123757693,2017-04-23T07:24:40Z,"""Me I Love Nairobi""... So (URL HIDDEN) authentic.. so homely!"
13381106,31567024,2017-04-16T08:34:17Z,"This is the perfect spot if you're looking for a quiet, charming and relaxing stay in Karen. Enjoy a coffee on the front porch in the cool Nairobi mornings or a glass of wine by the fire place at night, the brandy bus had it all. The location was close to all the sights we wanted to see and the staff were wonderful. We will definitely be back."
13381106,106909896,2017-04-10T12:19:45Z,"I stayed at the Brandy bus with my teenage sister who for the first time since she could operate a phone did not once ask me for the wifi password  All she wanted to do was take in everything about the bus and the peaceful compound it is in. I thought that she would be scared of the dogs when we arrived but Karen and Cathy may just have the most well tempered, good natured dogs I have ever met and I have 6 wonderful dogs myself. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and by the time we were leaving I was already planning our next trip. My sister has now crowned me the best sister in the world and if you know teenagers, this title is no small feat. I can thank the stay at the Brandy bus for our lovely bonding experience and I would advise anyone else planning on staying there to do themselves a favour and book more than 2 nights because the serenity at the Brandy Bus is not something you're satisfied with in just 48hours. Thank you so much for a lovely stay Karen and I look forward to returning soon with more friends/family.
"
13381106,110808167,2017-04-09T06:53:09Z,Its a very quaint place to stay! Beautiful grounds and quirky decor. Not great for those over 6ft but that wasnt too much of an issue. We had a lovely evening sat on the terrace by the chimenea :) 
13381106,20115168,2017-04-08T06:26:28Z,"What a unique and fun stay on the bus! It's well equipped, shower is amazing and fires outside at night were special. Karen was very good at communicating and although we didn't meet her, Rhoda who works there was super helpful! We were with our 2 boys and there was so much garden space for them to play and we made use of the tennis court. We will return to the bus! "
13381106,6036185,2017-04-03T08:40:53Z,"Everything was perfect! Communication, organisation, everything was great. The bus is magnificent!"
13381106,112410507,2017-04-01T08:34:34Z,"真的很棒,虽然不在市中心但是在凯伦富人区,适合体验生活的游客"
13381106,8129921,2017-03-27T05:51:50Z,"Not good for families, the facilities inside the bus are quite old, particularly the beds, may be good for bagpackers! Outside is beautiful, prize excessive given conditions .. cheers"
13381106,589030,2017-03-24T06:30:05Z,The Brandy bus is a unique home and very tastefully done and very comfy - outside and inside. The area is very quiet and safe ... the wifi could be better ... but other than that ... a great place 
13381106,94341215,2017-03-15T05:51:35Z,We loved our stay!  Would definitely recommend for a relaxing weekend away from the bustle of Nairobi. 
13381106,101216707,2017-03-10T06:59:21Z,"Anyone wanting cosy comfort, something a little different or something to make you marvel and smile... this is where you need to stay. No question. "
13381106,17766916,2017-03-09T07:49:10Z,"The bus is great for spending time together in a fun environment. It is calm and offers everything you need, including a good shower, small kitchen and a fireplace outside."
13381106,35462780,2017-02-26T08:47:20Z,"Es war genauso schön, wie auf den Fotos versprochen – sehr individuell und liebevoll! Karen hat sich wunderbar um alles gekümmert, was für unsere Ankunft nötig war! Sehr su empfehlen für Besucher, die eine sehr individuelle, liebevolle Unterkunft wüschen!"
13381106,31205604,2017-02-19T08:23:58Z,We had a wonderful stay at the Brandy Bus and were so impressed by its charm. Every detail was so thoughtful and it made our stay very special. Cathy and Rhoda were very attentive and helpful. They communicated promptly before and during our stay. We enjoyed a fire outside the bus and also found the inside warm and cozy. It is a perfect mini getaway for anyone trying to escape the hustle bustle of he city. We will definitely recommend the bus to friends and we also hope to visit again!
13381106,11985010,2017-02-15T06:15:11Z,"We loved the accommodation! Fantastic atmosphere inside the bus at a very nice location in a quiet corner of the garden. We will definitely recommend this to our friends, and hope to come again!"
13381106,13325446,2017-02-10T07:49:08Z,"It was one of the coolest places I stayed. The kids looooved the bus, which is in a big lovely garden. Karen was very helpful and so was everybody else on the compound! I can highly recommend a stay at the bus!!"
955115,593612,2017-05-04T14:17:34Z,As usual always a truly smart and elegant experience sleeping at Muse Haus
955115,119383578,2017-05-03T07:17:35Z,"Staying at Muse Haus was very impressive and memorable, in particular, everythings were well-regulated, also I'd like to express my thanks for very well arranged preparation.   "

955115,102392336,2017-04-28T08:57:44Z,Heerlijk plek en verblijf dichtbij de Theems en leuke restaurantjes!  
955115,105782433,2017-04-24T08:14:37Z,"豪华大床房,卫生间特别漂亮~适合家庭住。小区环境优美,房东人特别好,服务热情~"
955115,801025,2017-04-20T09:44:32Z,"Tolle Lage, super Abwicklung. Zimmer könnten mal neue, schallisolierte Fenster vertragen."
955115,44020168,2017-04-17T08:12:57Z,I and my family were impressed with the smooth running of this stay perfect information uncomplicated check in and check out location perfect just to recommend
955115,36555883,2017-04-13T07:57:15Z,Muse Haus is a pleasure to stay at as usual! Will be back in the next few weeks! It's our new go to place! 
955115,527516,2017-04-08T09:10:44Z,"Only stayed one night, but everything was superb I would recommend the place. "
955115,34249320,2017-04-05T09:04:32Z,Magnifique demeure bien décorée. L'hôte est hyper réactif ce qui est vraiment bien. Les échanges par mails sont clairs. La seule remarque si je dois en faire une c'est que c'est un peu excentré a mon goût.
955115,117762252,2017-04-04T10:47:39Z,"We stayed for one night in the master bedroom of the house. House was very easy to find, and instructions were extremely easy to follow. The house is gorgeous, and common areas are spacious, clean and welcoming. Our room was very beautiful. We heard some housemates while in the common areas, but every one was quiet all night well into the morning. We had 3 people in the room, and we all fit very comfortably. 10/10 would stay there again."
955115,6997184,2017-04-03T10:54:24Z,Such a beautiful place and we loved staying there! Will recommend it to others. Such a great concept! 
955115,10384111,2017-03-29T07:33:44Z,"Great accommodation in an elegant house. The host is not on-site and there's other Airbnb guests in the other rooms, so it's kind of more of a guesthouse than a home, but that's cool because it's a top quality guesthouse. Well equipped kitchen, comfy sitting room area, and stylish bedrooms. A great choice for a London stop over. "
955115,108856303,2017-03-28T09:16:48Z,"A very clean, quite and comfortable place to stay with easy access and close walkable proximity to public transit. "
955115,94639834,2017-03-23T09:15:34Z,Perfect- will use again 
955115,6365696,2017-03-22T08:35:12Z,"The apartment was really beautiful. The room was very spacious and well decorated. However, their house was about an hour away from the center. We liked being on the outskirts. It was a lot less hectic than being in central London. The only hiccup in our stay at the house was that the cleaning lady had asked us to leave at 10 when we were told check out was at 11.  The check in process very easy. "
955115,99269800,2017-03-20T08:25:43Z,Very nice experience here. Clean and comfortable house.
955115,65667063,2017-03-18T08:40:59Z,We only stayed one night unfortunately during a layover in London. The communication was great and because there is self check in it wasn't an issue when we were running late. We walked around the neighborhood on a Saturday morning and it was a great part of London to visit. 
955115,33393652,2017-03-15T10:55:27Z,Lovely house
955115,94949312,2017-03-14T09:30:12Z,"Easy to locate, check in and out. Lovely neighborhood with nice eateries away from the traffic and noise. The host was very considerate to set up additional bed for my children."
1032296,29324453,2017-04-30T06:18:42Z,"This B&B was a highlight of our trip to Italy. The home is comfortable, the countryside is beautiful, and the whole stay felt so relaxing. Breakfasts were delicious and substantial. We did the cooking class and wine tour, and would highly recommend that - we learned a lot and had a fantastic meal including the food and wine. I would go back here in a heart beat. "
1032296,4121093,2017-04-28T09:46:25Z,"Wonderful. Take a cooking class! We loved staying here and couldn't have enjoyed our cooking class more. She tailored it to our interests and taught us about olive oil, which was fascinating. Recommend staying with Eleonora wholeheartedly. She and her place are gems. 

Definitely recommend renting a car. It's a lovely drive from Florence to her place in the hills. Feels like it's out in the country but close enough to use as a hub to get into the city if you want. "

 "
1032296,51404848,2017-04-22T06:46:03Z,"Staying at Eleonora's was the best part of our trip! You must stay here if you can!!! This was like a vacation within our vacation; away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities one usually visits on European vacations, but close enough to go into Florence for a day trip and with no shortage of things to do around the area. Eleonora's house is SO beautiful, clean, and cute. She cooks the most amazing breakfasts. The full cooking class is a must and teaches you not only about Italian cooking but also general cooking skills. Definitely rent a car to get to her location, it is worth it so you can day trip into the Tuscan countryside - such as Volterra, Sienna, and the surrounding wineries! Again, this was the best part of our trip and we HIGHLY recommend staying here!!"
1032296,67092641,2017-04-16T09:14:12Z,"Our stay at La Cucina B&B could not have been better! Eleonora makes her guests feel so welcome in her beautiful Tuscan home from the start by greeting them at the door and offering all guests tea and coffee. The rooms and beds were comfortable and quiet which made for great sleeping, and the breakfasts she prepares in the mornings are above and beyond the usual continental breakfasts provided at any other B&B.  We did both the four course cooking class and the wine tours with the Florentine steak dinner and thoroughly enjoyed both! Be sure to specify when you book if you would like to do either with Eleonora. You won't be able to book those last minute when you arrive. The cooking class was such a unique experience and Eleonora was a fantastic teacher. It is obvious that she has a true passion and talent for cooking and teaching. The meal she helped us prepare was absolutley the best one we had during our entire trip to Italy (including Milan, Cinque Terre, Florence, Siena). The ingredients were so fresh and the recipes were representative of the local cuisine. The vineyard tours the next day were a ton of fun and Eleonora even brought homemade lunch snacks for us to munch on between stops. The florentine steak dinner that night was absolutley delicious and we were so glad that we waited for our first one ever to be cooked by Eleonora... it was well worth the wait! We would highly recommend La Cucina B&B for your next Tuscan food adventure. The experience was by far worth every penny. "
1032296,72077794,2017-04-11T06:19:59Z,"This was a perfect way to get an authentic Tuscan experience. Eleonora's home is the Italian cottage of your dreams with tons of love and character.

The wine tasting experience was private and filled with great wine and knowledge at a castle/vineyard up the road.

The cooking class was nothing short of amazing! We made 4 courses and eleonora makes sure that you master everything so that you can make these dishes at home.

There are two bedrooms so ask if the larger one is available. Such a great place to stay and relax while in Tuscany! "
1032296,9880223,2017-04-09T10:06:28Z,"Can't say enough about how wonderful our time with Eleanora was. Florence was on the last leg of our trip and I'm so glad because it was very restful after almost a week of hustle and bustle. The cooking class was by far the highlight of our entire trip. Maybe the best meal of my entire life. If you're lucky enough to book here (as she is almost filled up for the rest of her time in Italy - she is moving!) consider yourself blessed and enjoy the experience! Note, it is maybe 30-40 min outside of Florence. You will need GPS if you're driving, and I would recommend getting a car as the driver there and back from the center is amazing. "
1032296,91527361,2017-03-29T07:38:14Z,"This was a highlight for our trip. After running around Italy, it felt so wonderful to come home, relax, and enjoy time with Eleanora. We decided to take cooking lessons because we both love to cook - we learned more than we ever expected. Eleanora is a fabulous teacher, making sure we actually learn and cook correctly. We would love to return in a heart beat to stay with her again. It feels like home in Toscana. Non potrebbe essere meglio!!"
1032296,4869926,2017-03-28T08:41:15Z,Eleonora's place is an Italian dream come true. We felt very immersed in the Tuscan countryside and Eleonora was the most welcoming host. We opted for the cooking class and it was the highlight of our trip! We will never forget the wonderful experience we had here!
1032296,116147407,2017-03-26T08:21:14Z,"We loved staying at Eleonora's place -- it was both beautiful and tranquil. The breakfast was amazing -- the best food we ate in all of Italy, including any dinners! She is a gracious host, and we had wonderful conversations about food, life, and artistry. 
While this is a little off the beaten path (if you are traveling by Eurail like we were), it is definitely worth the effort. There is a bus stop nearby which you can take to the intercity train station network, which feeds into the main station in Florence. Eleonora was so kind to give us a ride in from the intercity train station, and helped us as well when we were leaving. We would stay with her again in a heartbeat."
1032296,102500003,2017-03-14T10:06:13Z,Eleanoras place was absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and we didn't want to leave the house it was so lovely inside! Eleanora cooked us wonderful breakfast both mornings and was great company. Would highly recommend to those interesting in staying in Tuscany. Plan to have a car with you to see more of Tuscany! 
1032296,72388753,2017-03-11T07:17:27Z,Absolutely fabulous! Stay here. Eleonora is an amazing host. She is so hospitable and goes out of her way to make sure you have a great stay at her home. She is an incredible cook and I highly recommend taking one of her cooking classes. Her home is beautiful with two sweet dogs and a duck! We had an incredible weekend here and would love to come again. Thank you Eleonora!
1032296,23721587,2017-03-08T10:45:41Z,"My husband and I stayed here while in Tuscany and did the cooking class with Eleonora - and it was truly a magical experience. The food, the wine, the lovely home - it was all so romantic. This was the best evening of our entire trip and I wish that I could experience it again. Thank you Eleonora, we will never forget you!"
1032296,95935907,2016-10-23T07:49:13Z,"Wow, just wow! Staying with Eleonora has been a highlight of my trip so far. The drive out to her charming villa is stunning, exactly what I pictured Tuscany to look like. Eleonora was so accommodating, organising a private wine tasting at a local vineyard, and a one on one cooking class which was An incredible way to spend the afternoon. I would recommend for everyone to come and stay with Eleonora. Unlike a hotel, she provides an experience. Food was AMAZING!!! "
1032296,94092913,2016-10-20T07:08:55Z,Stayed here a friend-recommended it as she had enjoyed her stay.  It was beyond my expectations we had a wonderful time! Great hostess made us feel at home immediately. We did the vineyard and wine tasting and paired 2 wines with wonderful 4 course meal that was delicious! That we prepared! Learned so muc about preparing food From Eleanora. Would highly recommend this  B&B and Italian cooking  class with wine tour.
1032296,77389160,2016-10-10T07:25:46Z,"Unfortunately, it did not work out for us to stay at Eleonora's Bed and Breakfast due to the uncertainty of my husband's work schedule. BUT, Eleonora very graciously allowed us to take a cooking class with her so that is what I am reviewing. I feel as though no matter what I say in this review it will not do the experience justice. First off, Eleonora's assistant, Paola greeted us very warmly and was a pleasure to be around. Eleonora had a great passion for not only cooking but also for teaching. In a very relaxed manner and atmosphere, she created a magical experience. 
We had the four course meal and every bite was amazing. From a real ""Foodie"", we not only taste with our mouths but with our hearts as well.  I can honestly say, that not only were our tummies stuffed by the end of the meal, but my heart and soul was overflowing. 
If you get the opportunity to take a cooking class from Eleonora, just do it.  It was beyond anything we could have expected! I felt so fortunate to have been able to have a cooking class by a chef of her caliber. Fantastic!! "
1032296,63493809,2016-10-08T06:43:38Z,"Dicht bij de bruisende stad Florence, maar met de rust en ruimte van het typische Toscaanse landschap. We hebben genoten van de mooie omgeving, de fijne accommodatie en de gastvrijheid van Eleonora. De kookworkshop is een aanrader: we hebben veel gelachen en geleerd!"
1032296,38619505,2016-10-06T01:26:06Z,"Our stay at Eleonora's was definitely our favorite and most memorable during all of our trip to Italy! Eleonora is kind, welcoming, and incredibly hospitable. Her place was very beautiful, and by far the most comfortable and homey in Italy. Eleonora's was a welcome retreat after days of touring other cities in Italy. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean, private and comfortable. She's an amazing chef, and we came primarily for her cooking class, but wished we could have stayed a few days longer! Her cooking class was very thorough and technical, and we learned many skills and things we would have never with any other class. My husband and I love taking cooking classes, and we both agree that hers was the best one we've taken. It was definitely one of the best meals we had in Italy, and the class was definitely well worth the money for all that we learned! We hope we'll have the opportunity to take more classes with her in the near future. She's lived and worked in the US before, so her English is great. 

It is about a 20 minute stay outside of Florence, so we would recommend renting a car to get there... it's well worth it, and the drive is scenic and beautiful! 

If you're going to Italy and love cooking, we recommend that you make this place part of your itinerary. Eleonora, thanks for a memorable and wonderful stay!"
1032296,35275105,2016-10-03T09:34:52Z,We had a great stay at Eleanora's B and B. We were lucky enough to do the cooking class and really loved the experience. Her lovely helper Paola really made us feel welcomed too. Eleanora is very friendly and happy and made us feel at home. Her house is beautiful and very relaxing. Thanks for having us. Matt & Tamara 
1032296,323578,2016-09-02T07:13:32Z,"Wonderful people and a terrific stay, likely the highlight of our 10 day trip.

I would recommend renting a car for this 30 minute journey from Florence city center (this also enables you to head south for a day trip). "
4439461,8761100,2017-05-10T17:46:11Z,"Highly Recommend- super host, attractive, well-appointed and very comfortable in a great location. I would repeat - an excellent AirBnB experience."
4439461,3550428,2017-05-08T18:01:40Z,"Great location between Pacific Heights/Lower Pacific Heights! Walking distance to Smitten, Salt and Straw, B Patisserie. Jeffrey was so welcoming and helpful, responds very quickly. Airbnb is private, super clean and hip. I would definitely stay again!"

4439461,23741722,2017-05-04T16:24:13Z,"这里是可以轻松游玩后回来的休息地方,交通方便,对面就是超市,停车方便,周末和晚上都不收费,喜欢他们的装修风格"
4439461,17053541,2017-04-29T17:31:55Z,"Jeff and Mike were excellent hosts! Their communication was stellar. They were happy to answer questions and offer suggestions for the area. They even let us leave our luggage in their place since we had a late flight. The area is great - lots of wonderful recommendations and centrally located to what we wanted to do. The bed is clean with wonderful sheets. The bathroom is nice and new - and I always appreciate it when hosts have extra towels! Overall, fantastic place to book and we plan on staying there for our next stay in SF!"
4439461,119282886,2017-04-26T18:29:40Z,The out building is a perfect spot for a stay in Ventura. The decor is high-end and has all the facilities for a really comfortable stay. Jeffrey was a great host and we felt very welcome and were free to come and go as we liked. The bottle of wine left in the kitchen was a lovely gesture too. We would certainly stay here again when we come to visit our friends in the area.
4439461,108189469,2017-04-24T18:24:49Z,"This place was perfect!  As a former San Francisco resident, it was close to all the places I love (including my sister's apartment), centrally located, had easy access to all types of transport, was unbelievably quiet with the windows closed, and was on the only block in the area that had power during the recent outage.  I will always stay here on my visits!"
4439461,549886,2017-04-19T16:16:35Z,"Jeffrey's place is great! Location is one of the best in the city, just a couple of blocks from Fillmore street and Alta Plaza park."
4439461,115676310,2017-04-13T15:58:55Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jeffreys & Mikes place. It is very much according to fhe pictures. Very clean, and in good condition. 
It's very central to restraunts, cafes, bars. Across the street is big grossery store. So easy to have breakfast, lunch and dinnner. 
Its also close to public transport or to use the cable car. It might be little difficult to park your car, you can always find places a couple of blokes away. They are free of charge between 16 in the afternoon and 10 in the morning, but during the day you can only use them for two hours. There is a public parking space next door, but it is quite pricy during the day. We where staying three days, and used an app ""spotonparking"" to find the most vaubule and best parking for us. 
Finally we very much liked the information before our stay, informative and quick response.
We had a couple of small talks with Jeff and Mike, they are very nice abd friendly We highly recommend at stay at their nice place in an vibrant, lovely neighbourhood. "
4439461,52970520,2017-04-09T18:10:32Z,"Perfect space! A spacious room with a large closet, a mini-fridge, and a very upscale bathroom. The room is situated among other private rooms, which have their own entrance from the owner's unit. I suspected there were other people staying at the same time as we were, but we could not hear them at all. Also, the hosts are very helpful and are willing to help you make your stay in SF as best as possible. Communication was always very responsive.

The neighborhood is VERY nice. Parking is always a challenge, but it is not a popular tourist area, so it is a bit more available. It is also pretty close to Fillmore street, which has a lot of restaurants and shops. It is a great way to be close to all the action and excitement, while still living in a quiet neighborhood. Lots of excellent food within walking distance too!"
4439461,9623624,2017-04-08T23:16:42Z,"Jeffs place is beautifully furnished, exceptionally clean and centrally located. He was also very friendly and went above and beyond our expectations. Will try to stay here again next time we're in the city."
4439461,9449235,2017-04-07T15:09:18Z,"Amazing host, and description is perfectly accurate. Great location!"
4439461,59187943,2017-04-05T18:39:01Z,Jeff and Mike are amazing hosts! This place is nestled in a great area for food and drink. It's also a $5 Uber ride to just about anywhere you'd want to go. Very centrally located and very safe neighborhood. One of the best AirBnB experiences we've ever had!!!!! Will definitely stay here again when we come back!
4439461,110885987,2017-04-01T16:14:03Z,"We stayed in this room twice in one week, at the beginning and at the end of our trip. Both times everything was perfect. "
4439461,67992780,2017-03-31T18:53:37Z,"Really beautiful room in a lovely historic house, beautifully updated. Very clean hip decor, super modern bathroom. I think the ceiling must be 14 feet high! We loved it. Our hosts could not have been more accommodating with our special requests. Cool neighborhood, we'd love to stay there again. "
4439461,110885987,2017-03-28T18:34:31Z,"Every aspect of our stay here was perfect. Jeffrey is very nice and accommodating and always responded promptly when I asked a question. The room was very clean and the bathroom was spectacular. It is in a beautiful neighborhood with a lot of parking nearby (metered, incl off street, download an app and usually you can add time to the meter using your phone). There are also  great restaurants very close by. "

The skylight in the bathroom was so awesome.
I loved that your suite is so centrally located and close to pretty much any amenity one would need on a vacation. Can't wait to come back."

They offer me meals, assisted in ordering me food and also allowed me to stay at their other house on a last minutes notice. Not to mention they were very caring as well and actually went out of their way to mingle and interact with their guests. I feel that these little actions really made my stay at Gangnam memorable and this really sets them apart from other hosts. 

I kinda wanted to stay a little longer but I Guess all good things will come to an end .Good job Jacy you were a great host!  "

La famille est aux petits soins avec ses hôtes, très à l'écoute est pleine de bon conseils.
Le lieu est extrêmement calme, pas excessivement loin du centre en transports, et la maison très agréable. La literie est une pure merveille !
Je recommande cet endroit sans hésitation, qui en plus fait l'effort de parler français... 
Ce fût un coup de coeur et je renouvellerai l'expérience !"

2535184,37429287,2017-01-03T10:12:12Z,"I stayed here over the New Year's holiday. It's a lovely bedroom and bathroom located about the family home. The family cat came to sleep with me each night and Maria Rita always had breakfast waiting on the table downstairs for me each morning. It was a lovely stay in Florence. I was able to walk into the city in about 35 minutes, but I could've easily taken a bus from one of the two stops 100m away from the front door. "
2535184,5017529,2016-12-22T10:48:26Z,"Although Maria Rita's place is not in the heart of the city it is a gem of a place to stay. About an hours walk or a short bus ride into the main streets of Firenze, Maria Rita & her husband have a wonderful loving household with their two small children. They offered us a wonderful breakfast and were helpful with navigating the local area and also finding places in Firenze to go and see. Would stay with them again in a heartbeat. A great family with a warm, loving place to stay."
2535184,85101650,2016-11-29T09:46:35Z,"Hi Maria Rita

Thank you for welcoming us into your home and making our stay comfortable. I really appreciated the range of breakfast available and at the early morning times we required it. It was lovely getting to know you and your family and we would consider another stay here when we are back in Florence!

Hope you have a lovely Christmas!

Best Regards

The house is really beautiful and comfortable, she will help you with directions, the neighborhood is a little far from Florence main attractions but she will guide you to get to them.  She is really prepared and will Try to help you in everything. I highly recommend also the restaurant La Porta Verde, near to her house , all her suggestions worked perfectly! Thanks María Rita! "

Very friendly and welcoming and a gorgeous room - nicely decorated, clean and with wifi and air-conditioning. Would recommend :)"

12414861,121996736,2017-03-27T02:15:41Z,"非常和睦的夫妻档,可惜没有见到猫咪"
12414861,26474608,2017-03-24T02:18:45Z,Jia was extremely hospitable and extremely helpful with us navigating around the area. The place itself was extremely clean and welcoming. We would of been quite lost on numerous accounts if not for Jia...
12414861,86819998,2017-03-22T03:02:32Z,"为了去迪士尼一共住了两天,过得非常愉快。房子离地铁站有一定的距离,但是离商场和吃饭的地方非常近,很方便。这次没有看到猫猫有点可惜。房间不算很大但是非常舒适。我们早出晚归没有太多时间跟房东相处,但是能感觉到房东的热心招待和很多贴心的小细节。谢谢房东~"

2647075,20893346,2017-05-07T07:29:03Z,Great room with the added bonus of a balcony. Close to public transport & we were able to park directly outside the property at the weekend. Would definitely visit again. 
2647075,24846101,2017-05-06T09:38:16Z,"The Balcony bedroom is spacious for two, just right at three, and has enough sleeping space for four. It's more accurately about a 15 min walk away from Ravenscourt Park station, and the station doesn't have a lift, so beware if you're carrying a lot of luggage -- you might want to alight at Hammersmith instead which has a lift, though a further walking distance. The staircase leading up to the room is very narrow and steep so be prepared for that too in the case of excessive luggage.

The view from the balcony is lovely in the morning, and you can walk along the Thames in less than 5 minutes. There's also a postbox at the end of the street in case you want to send postcards at your own convenience. 

The house's checkin and checkout system is very convenient, but that takes away some of the personal touch. We were slightly taken aback by the lack of warning about the non-working Wifi. (It is fixed now.) We did enjoy being able to store our own food and it was lovely meeting our global housemates in the common areas! 

This is a house in a nice, quiet area in West London, but the trade-off is that it's a bit far from Central -- can take nearly an hour in some cases -- and the walk to the station feels pretty long if you're carrying a lot of things. I might recommend the lower floor rooms instead if that's the case. 

With all these considerations, it's still good value for money and we slept well here. Thanks! "
2647075,18205516,2017-04-29T09:30:54Z,"Excellent place! Great location, helpful hosts with an awesome ""welcome packet"" filled with tons of useful information, and overall a very comfortable and posh place. Highly recommended!"
2647075,89975865,2017-04-28T12:13:49Z,Another lovely stay at J. Muse's place. Perfect location and a lovely big room at the top of the house.
2647075,9462007,2017-04-26T12:19:55Z,"The Balcony Bedroom was FANTASTIC. The whole house seemed great and I guarantee that every time I visit London I will stay here. It was comfortable, spacious, quiet, and easy to get to. So glad I found this place!"
2647075,14975897,2017-04-23T08:18:46Z,"Great place, exactly as described in the offer. All information provided by the host are accurate and helpful. We definitely recommend it!"
2647075,117237064,2017-04-22T07:51:59Z,My two friends and I spent a Friday night in the Balcony Room and thought the location of the house and the fact we could park in front of the house was brilliant. The room is a good size and the beds were comfortable. I wouldn't recommend the Balcony Room to those who have issues with heights or small children. One of my friends felt vertigo looking at the balcony :-) but I was ok and I'm not good with heights. The stairs to the balcony room are quite steep so not suitable for those with access issues either. On the plus side we all had a good nights sleep and a warming cup of coffee and cereal in the morning which set us up for the day. Muse Haus is good value for money!
2647075,102071656,2017-04-18T12:17:54Z,"The J. Muse place was very disappointing. I actually had to leave and cancel my stay as the place wasn't safe due to the broken window whose broken pieces were about to fall over a passer at any moment. The place cleanliness was very poor, especially the bathroom. High level of noise coming from the traffic from the main road outside as well as from the room extractor, nobody could actually sleep in these conditions.
I won't recommend this place, I am sorry. Hope things will improve in future."
2647075,6357201,2017-04-17T09:46:51Z,Second time staying at the Muse Haus and everything wonderful. The coffee in the morning from the mesptesso machine is especially good. 
2647075,67745501,2017-04-16T08:34:29Z,"The muse haus was fantastic. Instructions to the location were very clear and the room was beautiful; it's exactly as pictured. The house is great and clean, and I would definitely stay here again."
2647075,73721728,2017-04-12T07:17:04Z,Really nice host who want to make sure that you have a nice stay. Kitchen is kept clean and is well equipped.  
2647075,115499350,2017-04-07T10:23:35Z,"nice experience, great view on the balcony, elegant decorations! thumbs up to the capsule cafe!the only problem is the hot water doesn't work after 23:30 but I was too sleepy to find the manager."
2647075,110535877,2017-04-06T09:26:51Z,"我們入住期間最大問題是沒有wifi,這讓剛到倫敦的我們行程安排上有些難度。房間每日都有專人維持清潔,房東提供的路缐指示也很精確。"
2647075,108240092,2017-04-03T08:26:28Z,"Wonderful house

2647075,10430939,2017-03-18T11:16:04Z,This is a beautiful home and very quiet with lot's of options to relax.  We enjoyed our 3 night stay.
2647075,8980161,2017-03-15T09:10:24Z,"Bis auf den Zugang war alles bestens und wie im Angebot beschrieben.
Die Nachbarschaft an der Themse ist schon urig."

There are no kitchenware so you can't cook (There is water heater, dishes & cutlery) But it wasn't big problem.

""Family Mart"" (little super market) is near the metro station (Chengshan Road 成山路) about 10min on foot from our house. You can buy food, drink & goods."

"
4768858,71426099,2017-03-22T01:18:45Z,"Best experience in my whole trip. 
Interior was amazingly beautiful and big. Facilities were totally amazing. 

A movie projector is installed in the house and you can access and watch any single movie you want. Spent my whole night watching movie, having a beer and feeling graceful for how pretty the place is without sleeping. 

Was quite disappointed when I arrived the district as it was a very very old and tattered residential district, but totally amazed when in stepped into the door.

A very famous hotpot place (撈王laowang) that opens til 2am is located right opposite the district, also with a 24 hour korean bbq restaurant.

Only note is that the place is very difficult to find. Best way is to get god direction and ask for local resident in the district to help together at the same time.

Overall, I really wish that I could stay for a couple nights more and I'll DEFINITELY stay here again next time."
4768858,53267238,2017-03-21T00:33:16Z,"和闺蜜一起去住一天体验一下,房子很好,在老式小区,打开门后简直惊艳。感觉是别有洞天,大隐于世。房子收拾的很干净,阳光房很舒服,适合静静地躺一整天。小区周围吃的也很多,很满足的一次住宿体验。房东人是超好的一个姐姐,超级贴心nice,而且励志又幽默,光是和房东在(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)上交流,就觉得人生充满欢乐和希望。"
5811207,35334236,2017-05-10T17:46:29Z,Jesse is a great host .  The loft is fantastic.  The Neighbourhood  is quiet but central and I'd recommend staying here. 
5811207,24367699,2017-04-30T12:35:34Z,A very nice place to stay. I loved sitting in the Eames chair listening to records.

The outdoor area was perfect for sitting and enjoying a book, and I was really happy the weather this weekend allowed me to do so. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb. "
5811207,1458280,2017-04-16T18:09:07Z,"Jesse's place is located in a great area: convenient to other neighborhoods, ample parking, safe, and an absolutely gorgeous space.

5811207,364983,2017-04-07T14:17:21Z,"We stayed in Jesse's loft for three weeks. It was very centrally located, close to everything in Midtown, and a short drive or Lyft ride to other parts of the city we wanted to explore. It was quiet and safe, with big windows to let in light during the day, and the loft was cozy and larger than we expected. We loved the overall style, too -- the furniture, record player, decor. The kitchen was well equipped, and the washer/dryer was convenient for our longer stay. Since we were there for work, the desk and other places to work were great! It truly felt like home, and we were a bit sad to leave. Check in and out was seamless, and Jesse was very responsive."

Well, Jesse and his loft in Detroit wins my award for a nearly perfect space. Carefully picked Mid-Century Modern touches, comfortable furniture, and a complete wall of windows.

Zum Frühstück gab es bei uns eine Auswahl an Cornflakes, Kaffee, Tee, frisches Obst, eine große Auswahl an Aufstrichen, sowie Wurst und Käse für Toast oder Croissant und Muffins. Das Frühstück war sehr lecker. Auch die kleinen Eichhörnchen im Garten zu beobachten hat uns den Aufenthalt versüßt. 
Wir würden wieder herkommen."
36660,94875181,2017-05-06T08:24:05Z,"The cityscape which it is quiet, and is full of green. The house of the host was beautiful, and the garden and the terrace healed our heart. I enjoyed life like the U.K. Thank you very much!"
36660,116651876,2017-05-01T15:24:57Z,Agri and Roger were very nice hosts and the location was great. Thanks for a great place to stay! 
36660,70213957,2017-04-28T10:49:17Z,"Verblijven bij Agri en Roger is een fantastische ervaring. Superlatieven schieten tekort. Lieve en heel gastvrije mensen, een schitterend huis, een heerlijk ontbijt en een heel fijne omgeving om te zijn. Vijf minuten lopen vanaf de ondergrondse, en een kleine tien minuten van Finchley High Road, met winkels en restaurantjes. De binnenstad van London bereik je binnen 20 minuten, en na een dag in de stad is het heerlijk thuiskomen in Blenheim Lodge. Wij hebben genoten en het zal zeker niet de laatste keer zijn dat we bij Agri en Roger verblijven! "
36660,55301592,2017-04-23T07:45:43Z,"We loved our stay at Agri & Roger's place! It was close to the East Finchley station, which made traveling by tube quite easy! The breakfast was always filling, as well as having a beautiful view of the backyard gardens! Highly recommend. "
36660,2748816,2017-04-20T07:18:40Z,"Lovely place to stay, great location on the Northern line. Easy reach of highgate cemetery which was lovely in the sunshine.  Comfortable, large room, warm welcome and generous breakfast with good coffee. Great place to stay."
36660,24767379,2017-04-18T10:22:30Z,"Unser Aufenthalt in der Blenheim Lodge war sehr entspannend, was u.A. an der zuvorkommenden und bescheidenen Art unserer Gastgeber lag. Das Zimmer mit eigener Terrasse ist wunderbar gelegen; wir hatten ein ausreichendes Frühstück und die Nähe zur Tube ist perfekt. East Finchley bietet eine Vielzahl an preiswerten Restaurants und Pubs, so dass man nach einem anstrengenden Tag in der City gut Erholung finden kann."
36660,109988018,2017-04-12T09:05:01Z,What a wonderful place! 
36660,4176413,2017-04-09T08:20:07Z,"Agri and Roger are wonderful hosts, and the house is in a great location. This is our second time here and we will be back again."

36660,2187572,2017-03-25T11:42:17Z,This was our second stay with Agri and Roger in five years and once more they proved to be excellent hosts. The garden room has a lovely aspect and is adjacent to the bathroom. Breakfast sets you up for the day and you can watch the wildlife coming and going in the garden. Roger and Agri are ever helpful and pleasant people. 
36660,93001728,2017-03-20T10:33:29Z,"Roger & Agri's daughter greeted us upon arrival and showed us around, making us feel very welcome and at-home. A continental style breakfast is served each morning in a lovely dining room overlooking the picturesque garden. Each morning Roger would check in with us about our previous day and the current day's plans, and was always very friendly. The room was very warm and comfortable, and we wanted for nothing while we were there. "
36660,108639935,2017-03-12T08:52:03Z,An excellent choice for visitors to London.
36660,101973391,2017-03-07T08:53:02Z,"Agri und Roger sind sehr nett und sehr hilfsbereit, ich habe mich in ihrem Haus rundherum wohl gefühlt. Die Lage des Hauses ist für einen Besuch Londons optimal.
Ich würde beim nächsten Mal auf jeden Fall wieder zu Agri und Roger gehen!"
36660,35551178,2017-02-25T11:31:29Z,Agri and Roger are such lovely people. They are very kind and accommodating. Their room was exactly as described. The communication we received from them helped make the whole process so much easier especially considering this was my first trip to London. I am very happy with my stay and would stay again. 
36660,98405171,2017-02-17T11:03:54Z,Agri fue una excelente anfitriona! Muy amable y servicial! La casa hermosa y la habitación encantadora todo muy limpio. 
36660,17375500,2017-02-09T09:05:54Z,Lovely comfortable room with access to the large garden outside. Short walk to the shops public transport into the city and Agri is really helpful. All round lovely vibe there and would recommend it to anyone
36660,82223202,2017-02-05T00:58:56Z,Very nice room and friendly host. The house area feels safe and close to good transport links.
36660,88968736,2017-01-13T11:31:34Z,"I absolutely loved Agri and Roger's place. It was so cosy and wonderful! If you get the chance to stay at their place, you are lucky!"
6363373,1787613,2017-04-27T23:36:13Z,"Really Nice apartment !
Really Nice bed ! 
Clean and fonctionable ! 

Thank you "
6363373,99566905,2017-04-25T01:43:04Z,"首先入住很方便,房间和描述完全一致,工业风很赞~但是厨具还有上一任住客残留的痕迹没有清洗干净,位置离市中心确实远了一点,在一个很安静的居民区,每天早出晚归见到的都是老人家。但是由于离JR线非常近,也算方便,在我孙子町坐JR线路到天王寺出站经过一个商场换乘地铁御堂筋线是去市区最快的方法(御堂筋线经过心斋桥、难波和梅田)大概半个小时可以到达~民宿性价比高,但是退房时间10点确实有点早,然后每天没有人清洁人多了也是一个问题~最后房间比想象中小,感觉住四个人是极限了,希望对亲们有帮助~"
6363373,117773202,2017-04-19T02:24:54Z,Very modern and new!
6363373,2684711,2017-04-15T00:51:19Z,"I and my husband stayed at Asami's apartment for a month. We wanted to explore Osaka as a local, and for that, it was perfect. The room was spacious and all the amenities was there as promised. There are lots of local restaurants around the area, and we loved it. For those travelers who want local experiences and look for a spacious place (like family), this is perfect. It was little far from the city center (like Nanba or Umeda), but it was not much problem to us as we stayed out once we are out."
6363373,33330769,2017-03-17T01:16:16Z,位置还是比较偏僻的 但好在出去走五分钟就有JR 房东人很耐心但算不上热情 跟她道谢基本上都不回复 房间很漂亮 风格很喜欢 但是床品有点不干净 卫生间做的很好 很便利水也很大 其他整体都很好 
6363373,50896546,2017-03-12T01:55:04Z,Asami is nice and helpful and her apartment is clean and stylish. Highly recommend !!
6363373,46685293,2017-03-01T01:51:47Z,Very nice 
6363373,42142367,2017-02-20T00:54:25Z,"If you are looking for the best place to stay in Osaka with affordable budget..

This is the one.

Very clean, specious, convenient and accurate.
3 min. to train station and you can easily access to a heart of Osaka.
Asami is very kind and care people always.

I can tell from her messages.

I definitely recommended.

Thank you."
6363373,82239886,2017-02-13T23:27:02Z,Fantastic place to stay at. The apartment was beautiful and clean. A little out of the way but still an enjoyable place to stay at and helps you learn the rail system. 
6363373,112211506,2017-02-11T00:56:01Z,"不错的房源,位置很好,离车站很近,周围餐厅商店也很多,是个不错的选择"
6363373,42646105,2017-01-26T23:50:23Z,Industrial style apartment located in a neighborhood area. It is also a good for family!
6363373,37408993,2017-01-13T01:38:52Z,It's near the JR railway and convinient to go to (URL HIDDEN) house is exactly the same as the picture .
6363373,82994667,2017-01-10T01:09:21Z,Asami San's place is really good. The room is very clean and the location is perfect for me. I will definitely stay at Asami San's place again when I go to Osaka in the coming future!
6363373,45432997,2017-01-02T02:56:47Z,"Nice modern apartment sitting at a quite area, close to JR station, with convenience stores. Highly recommend!!"
6363373,34230472,2016-12-28T01:57:49Z,"Lovely and comfy place. Very close to station and convenient to everywhere
"
6363373,4123504,2016-12-19T23:56:15Z,"Asami's apartment was spacious and has a Zen feel to it which we really loved. Situated in a quiet neighborhood just a few minutes walk from the Abikocho JR station, it was really convenient. There's a Family Mart, and a really good and traditional mochi stall near the apartment which opens in the morning, not a mention a Uniqlo stall which opens from 11 am - just I'm case you need to grab a few more clothes.. Overall, we had a great stay in Asami's apartment, and highly recommend it to anyone who don't mind staying in a quieter place a little further away from the hustle and bustle of Osaka's downtown."
6363373,52038697,2016-12-16T02:23:38Z,"Asami's place is really nice! The open layout was great and very roomy for two people. Not really in a central location, it's a solid 10/15 minute walk to the subway, however the neighbourhood was lovely :) "
6363373,32753793,2016-12-05T01:20:09Z,"位于大阪的南部我孫子町,是个以居住为主的区域,附近有很多大大小小的超市,小饭馆和快餐也不少,距离关西空港比较近(1小时),到中心区乘坐JR(城际,3分钟步行)和近铁(地铁,10分钟步行)都比较方便(半小时),请注意大阪一日券二日券可以坐地铁但是不能坐JR。房子本身很满意,在一个公寓楼里,一室一厅一厨一卫改造成的开敞大空间,清水墙地顶工业风装修的很时尚,设施也很干净齐全好用,有毛巾浴巾拖鞋,空调洗衣烘干机吹风机微波炉煤气灶(火力很强劲),锅碗瓢盆调料,感觉住夫妇俩会相当舒适,住4-6个家人或好友也能凑合,不要怕互相影响就可以。"
6363373,77044091,2016-11-29T23:23:13Z,"An absolutely amazing place to stay and very very close to abikocho station, nice large living area with curtains to divide sleeping areas, thanks "
6363373,43361523,2016-11-21T00:08:42Z,"The place is nicely designed with all the facilities provided & situated at the quiet neighbourhood. Asami san is kind enough to mail us the phone left behind at the place after we have checked out.
I strong recommend this place for travelers in group with max 4 person, the place is close to JR station but not to the subway station, those who prefer subway, may change at next station, ie Nagai for subway to city center."
1072918,119987120,2017-05-11T06:22:58Z,"Bruno and family are wonderful hosts, our family of 6 were well looked after,  great apartment close to everything, shops, cafes, bus, bikes,metro etc..  after a day out walking around the city it was reassuring to come back to a nice place to relax. I would highly recommend this apartment and would love to book again when in Paris. Charmaine"
1072918,59258058,2017-05-03T11:08:24Z,"I confess that I traveled to many places using airbnb. I rented many apartments throughout Europe and South America, but Bruno's house is really beautiful, clean, comfortable and sophisticated. First of all I would like to thank the hospitality, say how much Bruno is friendly and personable. I felt very comfortable. Your flat is uniquely decorated! Everything is beautiful, everything is clean, everything is sophisticated. Highly recommended."
1072918,125391800,2017-04-28T12:31:46Z,décoration stylée!
1072918,71927087,2017-04-20T14:18:02Z,Un très bel et grand appartement dans un super quartier de Paris!
1072918,86023330,2017-04-19T09:35:02Z,"A beautiful apartment in a great location , bike hire in the street below and lots of good local places to eat ."
1072918,32196129,2017-04-16T07:11:25Z,Bruno and his family are great hosts and we had a fantastic stay. The apartment was a great choice for our family of three.
1072918,11317510,2017-04-09T09:10:42Z,Bruno's appartment is breathtakingly beautiful. Typical French Boudoir style with orient touch. It locates on the 5th floor of an Haussmann building with a lovely balcony with view. It absolutely a dream place to stay for unltimate Paris experience. 
1072918,104825883,2017-04-04T07:15:38Z,"What an incredibly interesting apartment. Tastefully decorated in true Paris style. We had drinks, snacks and breakfast on the balcony on the 4th floor. We had a wonderful time with our family and Bruno is was a real friendly and helpful host."
1072918,33026977,2017-03-31T09:05:49Z,"On perusing the sumptuous web-site, one could be forgiven for thinking that style had taken precedence over substance, but this would be a huge mistake. Style there is, in abundance, original, idiosyncratic, quirky even, but this is backed up by 100% substance. I could draw up a list of all the ways in which Bruno has gone the second mile, but a) my list would take up too much space, and b) it would be far from complete. Be in no doubt that Bruno has such a list and that it is checked twice, perhaps three times before each new set of guests arrive. We had a very relaxed stay - even the bizarre silver-gilt framed chair is remarkably comfortable.  Finally, Bruno knew when to offer help and advice if it was needed and when to withdraw discreetly. A perfect host of a wonderful apartment in a very interesting neighborhood."
1072918,55036946,2017-03-26T06:25:49Z,Host was quick to respond to our needs and provided good details for the home and area.
1072918,13884866,2017-03-18T08:41:14Z,It was a beautifully decorated apartment in a very central location and many restaurants close by. The best part was our host Bruno who was so accommodating and allow us to store our luggages before checkin n after check out  so that we can maximize our time in paris. He is a super host and even brought bread for us in the morning. We all loved Bruno collection of homewares n took lots of nice pictures while we stay there. Thank you so much Bruno and would highly recommend this place to others. 
1072918,1210249,2017-03-16T08:48:13Z,Bruno is great  host.Flat looks much bigger on the pictures.But we had pleasant stay.Thank You again.
1072918,58135808,2017-03-14T09:08:38Z,"La diferente decoración,i el buen gusto del conjunto"
1072918,795466,2017-03-11T10:06:47Z,Bruno and family made the stay very easy and pleasant.  He was attentive as a host but not smothering at all.  All around this was a wonderful place to stay on our fantastic trip to Paris!
1072918,34556924,2017-02-26T07:41:29Z,"What a gorgeous little place! Perfect for our stay and very very chic.  Fantastic location too. We couldn't have asked for nicer, more accommodating hosts, Vanessa and Bruno thank you for everything!"
1072918,103403271,2017-02-24T09:47:39Z,"The apartment is well situated, decorated wonderfully and Bruno is an amazing host.  We loved the area, it is perfect for seeing the sights and enjoying the local area."
1072918,5626482,2017-02-20T07:58:44Z,"Bruno's place was exactly as described - wonderfully-appointed interiors, great location and overall very comfortable. Bruno himself was friendly, warm with excellent communication and great recommendations for things to do/places to go. Would absolutely stay with Bruno again!"
1072918,112904245,2017-02-18T09:34:37Z,"房东人特别好,因为个人的问题,我们一直到当天的晚上11点半才入住,房东非常好,一直在等我们,第二天虽然11点退房,但是房东说你们的行李可以放我这里,等离开的时候再回来取行李,房间非常棒!不要错过!"
1072918,5463587,2017-02-17T07:04:21Z,clean and very easier to stay there. the lift made it easy with our luggage.
1072918,72724418,2017-02-13T07:06:37Z,"Bonne accueil. Et cela a toute heure. 
Super appartement !"
4740265,13836842,2017-04-03T05:41:19Z,It was very comfortable and safe place. It was close to main place where you want to visit in Nairobi. Katrina was very helpful and sensible to arrange everything we need. Happy to see you guys and hope to see you any time soon! 
4740265,2103467,2017-03-26T07:11:55Z,"This place is exactly as it appears in pictures- gorgeous garden, comfortable sleeping area, fully stocked kitchenette, and wonderful shower.  HIGHLY recommend staying here if you find yourself in Nairobi!"
4740265,11073467,2017-03-11T06:06:10Z,"Fantastic place! Wonderful quiet garden, beautiful house, and great hosts! Definitely recommended "
4740265,11257176,2017-03-07T05:33:21Z,"The house is not only as described perfectly, it is even much better. Beautiful and plenty of small details,  very clean, calm, with everything you need. It is placed in a very nice, green, clean, calm and safe environment in Muthaiga. I enjoyed my stay in the house as if it was my own house, enjoyed as well the beautiful garden, wonderful. 
But even with all this, what makes this place the perfect location are the hosts: Katrina and Yaniv always very helpful, providing plenty of information about the city, places to go, where to eat. They are now my friends! 
As well, using Uber or cabs, small runs to many places as Westlands, Gigiri (UN), CBD, Parklands, Village Market and Two Rivers. 
Thank you Katrina and Yaniv for being so wonderful. !!

I absolute recommend this place for your stay in Nairobi! 
"
4740265,55728013,2017-02-19T05:21:36Z,This place is exactly as it's described - Yaniv and Katrina are the perfect hosts with a detailed knowledge of everything you could possibly do as a tourist and the things to do whether you are traveling on business or pleasure. Cannot recommend this place enough for both cost and location. Lovely safe neighborhood.
4740265,104915298,2017-02-04T05:21:26Z,"I had a wonderful time here. The apartment is spacious and located in a garden, getting up, you will look on lush green on all sides. The decoration is just lovely and the service (daily housekeeping and laundry on weekdays, musli, coffee, fruits, juice and even Gin Tonic to serve yourself) exceptional for an Airnbn. Yaniv and Katrina are wonderful hosts, very warm and helpful. The neighbourhood is very green, lots of embassies, and the nearby Karura forest to stroll and chill, there is a small shopping complex nearby, where you can get pretty much everything you need ( there is even a small massage place). I will defintedly come again"
4740265,1387679,2016-12-21T08:05:40Z,"Yaniv made our planning and arrival easy with great communication and lots of useful info. The cottage was lovely, with lots of ambience and personal touches. Some snacks and the G&T corner were a welcome touch. Great location with easy access to shopping, restaurants, Karura forest, etc. The gardens were also lovely. Didn't get to meet Yaniv or Katrina as they were out of town, but still had easy communication with one of his colleagues - so everything was great. Thanks for hosting us!"
4740265,2612127,2016-11-27T07:14:42Z,"This is it. You can stop looking. Yaniv and Katrina's place is central, quiet, cosy, unfussy, and convenient- everything you need to clean up and unwind after a day exploring Nairobi. This is a lovely base for any holiday, and thanks to taxis (motorcycle and otherwise), it's a breeze to get to Karen and other haunts. Having the Karura Forest ten minutes' away is an incredible luxury. "
4740265,58637950,2016-11-14T07:53:01Z,Beautiful suite in a very private setting. You won't regret a stay with Yaniv and Katrina. 
4740265,5293977,2016-11-04T08:51:07Z,"Thanks for a GREAT stay. A lovely oasis close to UN Avenue where I had to work. So nice to be in a very nice, safe, clean cottage instead of a hotel. Yet, Katrina made sure there were lovely snacks and treats- granola and yogurt, juice, chocolate bar (thank you!) and coffee with French press, among other treats. Very responsive, made sure I was comfortable. Overall fabulous place and hosts in ideal location (safe, next to Karura Forest and UN buildings). Thanks!"
4740265,17745737,2016-10-15T05:07:05Z,"It was really nice, coming late at night ""home"" after my arrival, finding cold gin and tonic with lemon in my fridge. And the bed was perfect to sleep in. Next day I met Yaniv an Katrina.  What a nice couple, with all the attention the gave to make my stay a fantastic experience. 
A beatiful garden is available so you don`t have to stay insite!!
Extraordinary I slept in the house my Kenyan friend lived for ten years in the nintees and Yaniv immeddiatly invited him and his wife to visit. Spoken about hospitality. So I recommend this B&B, me and my wife are also owners of a B&B, so I know when a B&B is perfect or not."
4740265,35026545,2016-10-01T05:18:27Z,"I can't thank this beautiful and generous family enough! I had a little bit of a rough start arriving in Kenya, but the minute I was in Yaniv and Katrina's care all of that changed. Can't wait to stay here again!"
4740265,5715443,2016-09-30T07:06:11Z,"Wow! What an amazing warm and comfortable landing on my first day in Kenya I wish I would have booked for more days. I was welcomed by Patience and Richard in the morning and while the room was being made up for check in, I stored my bags in their home and was provided a list of things to do in the area. When I arrived Yaniv came and checked in with me to ensure I had all I needed. The reality was I had everything and more, including a lovely help myself gin bar with fresh limes, juice, fruit and other snacks. Yaniv also invited me for dinner along with friends and was very engaging on recommending places to eat, knowing all the restaurants in the city. 

The location is quiet and superb near the forest and embassy's. My morning was wonderful although quick. I slept really well as the bed was really pleasant and there was a lovely selection of breakfast, yogurts, bread, granola, spreads, teas etc to make the morning very easy. 

I definitely recommend this location and will return on business in future. 

"
4740265,31040255,2016-09-30T05:56:02Z,"We had another great stay at Yanev and Katrina's beautiful suite. Their neighborhood is conveniently located near some good places to shop and eat. There is also a beautiful forest with hiking trails within walking distance from their house. Once again the suite was fully stocked with gin, tonic and fresh limes and fixings for breakfast. Additionally, they were very accommodating when we asked for a late check out since our flight left at night. We look forward to future visits and will definitely recommend their place to friends traveling to Nairobi."
4740265,31040255,2016-09-21T03:20:28Z,"We had a lovely stay at Yaniv and Katrina's beautiful suite. They arranged transportation from the airport and we ended up hiring the driver for the next few days for site seeing. The neighborhood is lovely as are the grounds where their house is located. The suite is really spacious and nicely decorated. Little touches like bud vases with flowers throught the suite, a small bar with ingredients for gin and tonics, a little area with all you need for a simple breakfast or snack made it feel even more luxurious. Yaniv checked in with us to see if we needed anything and had great suggestions for things to do and restaurants to try. We plan to stay at their place again when we return to Nairobi next week."
4740265,5027371,2016-08-30T06:24:24Z,"It is really hard to explain this Airbnb experience in 50 words or less. Our stay with Yaniv and Katrina had to be the very best experience we ever had..and we travel a lot! We were actually sad to go as we felt completely at home. No detail was left aside. Besides the beauty and tranquility of the space, we were welcomed with a tidy room every day and well stocked cabinetry with goodies. A full sheet with property explanations, guidance and suggestions for enjoying the very best area options was ever so helpful. We hope others seeking lodging in Nairobi will opt for this bit of paradise...just as we hope Yaniv and Katrina will have us again next time we're in the area!"
4740265,6266588,2016-02-14T17:51:34Z,It was fantastic staying at Katrina and Yaniv's house. They took care about everything. They organised a driver and offered to order food and place it in the room as I arrived late. There was Gin and Tonic waiting in the room and an iPhone that I could use during my stay. Thank you so much!
4740265,13886984,2016-02-12T11:57:57Z,"You honestly couldn't ask for more from a host! The guesthouse was gorgeous, the property grounds were equally stunning. If you needed any assistance with anything Katrina will have it settled within a matter of a couple of minutes. The pantry was fully stocked with tea, coffee, breakfast choices and most importantly snacks. The property is in one of the best locations and pretty much central to everything whether you choose to walk or commute. I've already recommended friends to stay with Yaniv and Katrina and I strongly recommend that you do the same!"
4740265,27181039,2016-01-24T12:22:53Z,"Yaniv and Katrina were outstanding hosts.  The room was impeccably prepared with every thought given - extra towels, food in the pantry, toiletries, and even lots of candles and flashlight which came in handy as we had power outages.  Topping it all they had a cel phone in the room with credit so that we could use it to communicate with them and around town they had thought of everything.  They checked in on us right when we arrived and offered to help in any way. Their staff were also very helpful at all times.  We felt like we were their guests. I don't think any Airbnb experience  will ever top this!"
4740265,19902737,2016-01-06T02:17:38Z,Very satisfied. See previous review. 
1054819,9893867,2017-05-08T07:35:48Z,Great hosts. Very comfortable. 
1054819,5458163,2017-05-01T07:33:02Z,Perfekte Wohnung für London!
1054819,54958028,2017-04-15T09:22:00Z,"The flat is great and has enough space for 4 people (our kids are 15 and 18). Everything is very clean and we found everything we needed. We even made use of the DVD collection watching a film together ;-). 
The next overground/underground (Kensingtion Olympia) is only a couple of minutes away, still the flat is in a very quite area. We enjoyed our stay and the flat's location is ideal for London sightseeing. "
1054819,7127100,2017-04-10T07:06:03Z,"We were at Olympia working, Will and Emilia""s Place was a god send, very handy for the exhibition center,spotlessly clean and tidy, which was great to come home to every day.  The apartment was so handy for supermarkets, restaurants etc, which made it less stressful for us.  Will arranged extra cleaning for us while were there, making our stay that bit more enjoyable.
thanks again for being great hosts."
1054819,52861911,2017-03-21T11:19:18Z,"Clean, well-designed, and in an unbeatable location. Check-in was scheduled for 2 but we were able to leave our bags and collect the keys at 12, which was quite nice (we messed up the timing a bit, but Will was more than accommodating). The location is a very short walk from shopping, a park, plenty of restaurant options, and the Underground -- which made all of London accessible from a relatively quiet street. It's small, but larger than a hotel room that would cost as much or more with a tenth of the charm.

We were quite self-directed, so I can't say much about Will and Emilia's concierge talents, but I am sure they would have been helpful had we asked. There are two laminated sheets in the flat -- one has an excellent list of local restaurants and attractions, the other directions to anything you might want to find, which was great. Will's instructions from Gatwick were clear and saved us quite a bit of time and money over our original plan (a hire car). 

I highly recommend it as a base of operations for London!"
1054819,62530791,2017-03-19T09:12:24Z,very good place with reasonable price! will definately recommend to my friends!
1054819,44976188,2017-02-26T08:31:51Z,"i stayed at this flat almost to the date a year ago. i stayed a bit longer this time. i love the location and the space. it's easy for trains and uber, some nice pubs walking distance. i used the kitchen this time and all that you need is there, maybe one more fry pan ( ;-} ), but that's minor. i love the bed and slept well every night. feels like a home away from home. great hosts, great place!!!! thanks once again!!! ;-}"
1054819,27117970,2017-02-19T08:07:56Z,"The apartment is neat  and clean. Ideal for a couple, but also good for 4 as the two futon-sofa's sleep well in the salon. All is taken care of in great detail, with clear instructions and tips. Will was very responsive and helpful through messaging, as we found this place at the last minute. Great value for money and a fantastically quiet sleep. "
1054819,16184813,2017-02-10T09:53:12Z,Lovely warm clean apartment in a nice area. Highly recommended :) 
1054819,62100168,2017-02-08T08:49:31Z,"Quiet road, easy for Olympia. Lovely little flat, hosts friendly and helpful. Beats staying in a run of the mill mainstream hotel any day
Recommended!! "
1054819,34562312,2017-02-06T08:08:28Z,Stayed with Will and Emilia the second time! Always a pleasant experience :) thank you so much for hosting us!
1054819,13162993,2017-01-17T11:20:12Z,"Lovely comfortable flat in a quiet road and well located for those visiting Olympia. Will was really prompt, friendly and efficient. A simple and enjoyable stay. Thanks"
1054819,108635714,2017-01-14T10:09:53Z,"Great flat, short walking distance from public transport. We were able to check in before the assigned time which is great for early flights! We really enjoyed our experience here!"
1054819,18226359,2017-01-07T11:47:31Z,"Nice place, good location, would recommend"
1054819,98927116,2017-01-02T09:23:22Z,"This flat was really great to stay for a long weekend. We enjoyed most bits of it. Only thing to point out is that you have time to pour yourself some coffee while waiting for the hot shower to come, but once it is here it's a pleasure to be in this italian shower after a walking day in the london center :)"
1054819,93739265,2016-12-20T11:20:30Z,"There are no hidden secrets here. A great place. Small but modern, clean great location to Olympia event center. If you are attending an event there - this is your place! Will was amazingly attentive to some very needy first timers not only in London but also to Air bnb. We settled in right away and loved the neighborhood we were in. Felt very safe at night. Used public transportation which was close but mostly used Ubber .which worked great for this location.
As a result of this postive experience, we will seriously check out Air bnb options for our next travels. "
1054819,79032555,2016-12-12T09:15:48Z,Beautiful flat in a great area. Lovely stay! 
1054819,18183257,2016-12-04T10:24:20Z,A lovely stay in a styish flat. We were given a very warm welcome by Barbara who showed us round and made us feel at home instantly.
1054819,36457240,2016-12-02T09:08:45Z,Very clean and exactly as pictured.  Will was very nice and helpful.  Prompt communication! Great flat. Would highly recommend it.
1054819,102551888,2016-11-28T08:37:09Z,We had a great time. Ideal spot if you are visiting exhibition road. 
8727047,21418784,2017-05-07T13:47:54Z,We really enjoyed our stay here. Apartment is big and in a good location which was ideal for us. Rose made everything really very easy for us whilst we were there. Wifi was bit hit and miss but not much of an issue. Place is comfy and ideal place to be based in Nairobi. 
8727047,3231159,2017-04-26T10:09:15Z," I am world traveler and I use a lot the privilege of AirBnB, I was very impressed by the apartment of Rose, it is clean, vast, it is located inside a very nice compound that I consider of high quality, the security at the gate were very polite, I felt very safe by all means, Rose was very accurate person and very helpful. see you again Rose...!!!"
8727047,30177528,2017-04-21T10:26:07Z,This is forever on my list as a first choice anytime i head to Nairobi. Rose is a really helpful and responsive host. Nothing but good things to say
8727047,21375056,2017-03-27T07:43:58Z,nice apartment
8727047,44694851,2017-03-22T07:58:55Z,Good place to stay in a safe environment.
8727047,11664225,2017-02-15T07:49:27Z,"Great location and flat, but lots of stairs (flat is on the fourth floor!). We had a great stay and Rose was a fantastic host. "
8727047,26514950,2017-01-02T06:21:27Z,"We had an amazing stay at Rose's place. Great apartment, great location, and Rose was a fantastic host- very helpful and always responded quickly. Highly recommend, and we hope to stay there again in future!
Thanks Rose!"
8727047,1521515,2016-12-08T05:13:02Z,"Rose was very accommodating and the apartment was nicely decorated. I felt very much at home while I was staying in the apartment. I was there on business and it was in a terrific location. 

The only downside: no elevator (about 5-6 flight of stairs to the top - great workout!) and my bedroom water heater didn't work. However, that wasn't a problem since there was one other open room and that shower's water heater worked. "
8727047,56001968,2016-12-03T07:46:19Z,Thank you for all the help
8727047,30177528,2016-11-25T05:58:42Z,"Apartment is EXACTLY as described; very clean and cozy. The location too is very ideal especially if you have business in town.
Rose was very receptive and quick to respond to questions we had.
Would absolutely recommend! 
Awesome spot."
8727047,65488284,2016-11-20T08:15:37Z,"Rose was absolutely lovely! She met us promptly at the apartment when we arrived. The apartment was exactly as the pictures showed it to be - super clean and simple with all the amenities one would need to have a comfortable stay in Nairobi. Security at the gate was extremely safe and the location was perfect for getting around the different neighborhoods. The apartment even had its own parking space which was perfect for our rental car! We could not have asked for a cleaner, more comfortable place to stay during our jam packed weekend in Nairobi! Thank you Rose for all of your hospitality and dedication to making our first trip to Nairobi an unforgettable one! "
8727047,81481874,2016-11-15T07:03:19Z,"Rose's apartment really does feel like being at home. Major bonus points for the Eat Out magazines sitting around that help direct a visitor to less well-known, but great gems on the Nairobi restaurant scene. 

The internet was fast & reliable, the shower was always hot when I wanted, and the washing machine worked great. Also, despite the fact that there isn't air conditioning, the apartment stayed cool because it doesn't get too much direct sun. 

Be aware that it is on the top floor, so there's a lot of walking up & down stairs, but if you're trying to get some exercise, it's a great way to just naturally fit it in. The only other word of warning is that the refrigerator freezes most liquids, so if there's a way to turn it down a little that would be quite helpful. "
8727047,11664225,2016-11-12T08:50:48Z,It would have been great to have mosquito nets but otherwise the apartment was fantastic and Rose was a perfect host. 
8727047,9652751,2016-11-06T05:31:54Z,"Rose's home was a great place to stay; we have no complaints. Check-in and check-out were hassle free, and she was responsive to all questions. I recommend staying here."
8727047,13087497,2016-11-02T07:05:37Z,"Excelente apartamento, para el standard de Nairobi. Cómodo y buena zona, aunque hay que ir a todos sitios en coche, como en todo Nairobi.
Gracias Rose"
8727047,7153659,2016-10-27T05:47:51Z,"The apartment is great! The pictures are accurate, the place is very well equipped and everything works very well. The location is very good, very close to many shopping centers, with a small swimming pool and very friendly and helpful security staff. 

And of course, Rose is a wonderful host. very good communication - even gave us security updates! "
8727047,23700749,2016-10-14T05:36:19Z,"Rose's is a spacious apartment in a secure complex that is a short drive away from the city centre, malls, restaurants, etc.

My stay was made pleasant by her attention to great service: the warm welcome I received, her anticipation of needs I might have had before I asked, cleanliness of the house and amenities available."
8727047,26194953,2016-09-24T01:51:16Z,"Rose est très sympathique et très arrangeante. L'appartement est très propre et fonctionnel. Très bon accueil, je recommande cette location."
8727047,5868878,2016-09-07T06:23:08Z,"Rose's apartment is very spacious, tastefully decorated and well-equipped with all the amenities you'd need! Including an instant shower heater, which we definitely appreciated after a long drive from safari. All the bedrooms had ensuite washrooms and big, comfy beds."
8727047,11092631,2016-09-02T02:48:19Z,"We really had a good time at Rose’s place and she was a wonderful host. We arrived on a flight that got us to her place in the wee hours, and were pleasantly surprised to find Rose waiting for us. She had even prepared some food and soup for our two kids, which was a really nice of her.

Rose’s place is very well located. The flat is in a secure, gated community of working families. Our kids, who are 5 and 7, loved the play area downstairs. The flat itself is clean and spacious and provided more space than we actually needed. Rose allowed us to help ourselves to her stuff in the kitchen, and we did. Transport to and from any of Nairobi’s attractions was a breeze using Uber. Within minutes our ride would at the gate, waiting to shuttle us wherever we wanted to go.

Overall, we really recommend Rose’s place, whether traveling singly or as a family. We hope to be back some day, if it’s still available."
4909611,109796113,2017-05-01T03:22:41Z,"非常完美的体验,凌晨到达日本在房东之前的告知下自行方便顺利的办理入住。早上房东热心的送了一瓶果汁。图片和实物相符,一切都温馨和整洁干净。有机会还会再来体验。"
4909611,30578862,2017-04-26T01:20:39Z,"This is what a Superhost is all about! We saw the hosts everyday, they brought delicious apple juice and helped us by driving us to the station to pick up the rental car. The house is amazing and extremely clean! The neighborhood is very nice and reachable through the JR Line. Not the most central but we never felt it to be troublesome and the overall quality surpassed this minor issue."
4909611,39825769,2017-04-23T02:52:45Z,It's a very good space probably the most spacious and comfortable accommodation we had in our entire trip in Japan. The only drawback is the location as you need to change atleast two metro lines or more to get there. Else the hosts are very active and respond to you immediately check up on you everyday and very courteous even got us fresh apple juice one day :) Overall we had a good experience staying at Zen's House 
4909611,82946451,2017-04-19T23:46:06Z,"Excellent stay. You get what you see, as advertised in the listing photos. Would recommend(and already have) for any stay near Tokyo.

Despite being an Airbnb, everything is run as professionally as possible: daily room service + fresh towels, low cost luggage hold pre/post check-in/out if needed, detailed directions to/from airport and apartment, and they even helped acquire Ghibli Museum tickets a month in advance (purchased for us when they went on sale in Japan - paid for on arrival/check-in).

The local train station is walking distance, as are a variety of shops and a daytime street market. The apartment has good Wifi, and we were also provided with a portable WiFi device (about the size/dimensions of a cellphone) - great for internet access on the go, if you don't have an international/roaming-enabled data plan.

The K-Family in particular were also very accommodating. From helping get Ghibli tickets in advance, to dropping us off at a more convenient station for getting to the airport on checkout day... They are reasonably fast to respond to any communications, and sometimes even dropped us notices on events going on that we may consider. 

Definitely a consideration for any future visits. "
4909611,22927304,2017-04-10T23:56:53Z,"第二次入住K的房子,房间在三楼,除了厕所在外面并不是很方便但也没有大的问题。卫生各方面都很好,依然每天都有果汁。可惜K的房子太火爆了不能多住几天。交通,位置都是我满意的。适合想要安静住些天的人。以后还会再来。希望可以订到二楼。谢谢!"
4909611,47226087,2017-04-09T02:36:17Z,K-Family is very friendly and helpful. They help us keep our luggages on day before we check in. And send us a tasty apply juice. The home is nice and convenient. There are many restaurants open 24 hours. We enjoy to live it his home very much!
4909611,84250740,2017-04-04T02:11:37Z,The K family were very accommodating great to communicate with and had a wonderful time with them at the cherry festival. Would recommend to anyone
4909611,42382153,2017-03-30T02:40:25Z,It's a well renovated apartment with reasonable price. The location is a bit off but we enjoyed our stay!
4909611,5470346,2017-03-28T23:21:07Z,Cozy place in a charming area (Captain Tsubasa's inspiration for those who know). The coffee maker coming along with tasty coffee is a must (even more enjoyable thanks to the nearby bakery ;)).
4909611,36218598,2017-03-25T02:31:18Z,"This apartment is beautiful and in a easily accessible location by train. The neighborhood is beautiful pleasant. It was the perfect place to end our excursions into Tokyo central.

Would definitely stay here again!"
4909611,98989195,2017-03-18T23:06:54Z,"安靜,舒適,整潔。我們的房間是在整棟公寓的3層(這裡3層都是民宿哦,超厲害的!),房間不算太大,但是入住4個人還是沒有任何問題,獨立的洗手間、浴室和衛生間,智能馬桶非常的舒服。周邊很安靜,睡覺特別的舒服。熱心的房東會送好喝的蘋果汁給我們,而且check out的時候還可以用車載我們到車站(雖然我們沒有用到,但還是要感謝房東)。關於交通的話,從立石車站下車步行大概需要5分鐘,中途會路過100円商店、LAWSON、FAMILY MART、松屋,所以生活還算比較便利。需要注意一點的是,房東沒有提供室內的居家拖鞋,雖然地板超級乾淨,但在3月的季節還是會有一點點涼腳,希望房東能改進一下。"
4909611,68182330,2017-03-11T00:44:11Z,"中间有一天去箱根,第二天继续回这里住,看到牌子上写着欢迎回来,感觉特别温馨!!不多说,这家民宿真的超级棒!希望下次去东京还能继续住到这里!"
4909611,68182330,2017-03-07T23:23:57Z,"房东的指引做的很好,让人轻松找到房子,一进去就很喜欢,感觉很舒服,设备很齐全,还有咖啡机简直不要太棒!厕所在外面稍微有点麻烦,早上房东还送了一大瓶果汁来,还送我们去车站,超级棒的!"
4909611,106985574,2017-02-26T01:40:11Z,"Good house . Thank you very much!!

4909611,105172169,2017-02-24T01:04:15Z,非常愉快的一次入住体验。周围很多特色的居酒屋和烤肉屋等 离地铁站京成立石站只需三分钟左右的步行时间 临走送了我门礼物 并开车送我们到达AOTO站让我们一部车直接到成田空港非常感谢主人。
4909611,74543294,2017-02-15T03:07:00Z,"Zen House is very suitable for family and friends. Me and my friends, 4 people in total, enjoyed our staying here. The apartment is clean, well furnished and comfortable. Mr. Kawano gave us gift and met us in the apartment. The apartment is 5min walk from the station, with convenience stores and restaurants nearby. Mr. Kawano drove us to the station after checking out. In a word, it's enjoyable!"
4909611,102540811,2017-02-12T00:54:25Z,"房子离京成立石站很近 两分钟可以走到罗森 四分钟左右到全家 对面就是地铁站 去地铁站的一路上都是餐厅 有家叫牛繁的烧肉挺好吃而且不贵
房间里除了牙刷牙膏什么都有 连咖啡机和吐司机都有!房间向阳 早上煮一壶咖啡烤两片吐司坐在阳台前 哇。
房东人超级好 入住前发好多邮件问了一大堆问题 每一封都有很认真的回复 因为行程没安排好房东也是二话不说让我们提前入住 发现wifi密码不太对跟房东讲了之后就""coming soon"" 每天送我们一大瓶饮料 走的时候还送我们到去机场比较方便的aoto station 告诉我们几点发车 并再三叮嘱怎样坐车 最后朋友落了一件羽绒服在房间里 房东收拾的时候发现了 正准备寄过来...真的人好得我们都不好意思了……"

4909611,106325866,2017-01-26T23:02:34Z,"청결, 친절, 서비스 등 모든 것이 완벽했다고 말씀드리고 싶어요. 도쿄 시내에서 조금 떨어져 있기는 하지만, 지하철 역이 숙소에서 가까이에 있을 뿐더러 도쿄 외곽의 정취 또한 느낄 수 있었던 곳이었습니다. 또 목재로 마감된 집 내부는 안락한 느낌과 특유의 일본스러움을 느낄 수 있게 해주었습니다. 나리타 공항까지 편하게 이동하고 싶으신 분들께도 아주 좋은 선택일 것 같네요. 숙소에서 가장 가까운 역에서는 나리타 공항으로 바로 가는 열차를 운행하고 있기 때문입니다. 호스트 분들은 다양한 외국인 분들이셨어요. 독일인부터 일본인까지.. 선물로 사과주스도 주셨네요^^ 이동 시간과 그에 따른 비용이 큰 문제가 아니라면 이곳으로 숙소를 결정하시는 건 아주 좋은 선택일 듯 싶습니다."
610985,45902499,2017-03-31T08:11:46Z,"Beautiful place, with original Frescos like museums, clean, warm,comfortable, has everything you need. Centrally located, quiet and safe , next door to Four seasons Hotel and a few meters  from Accademia del arte where David Statue is. And less than 7 minutes walk from Duomo. Loved it ❤would definetly stay there again. Reem/jordan "
610985,84565562,2017-02-06T09:08:54Z,"Everything about Cristina's place was wonderful: full of character, spacious, spotless, fantastic location, great communication. Will definitely be returning soon."
610985,106099388,2017-01-14T07:47:35Z,Perfect!
610985,98615906,2016-10-15T09:46:31Z,"Excellent location, a charming home with lots of character & style, managed by a caring & considerate host."
610985,44471852,2016-10-10T01:08:28Z,"Cristina's colleague, Giuseppe, met us at the apartment, which is wonderfully located, just a ten minute walk from the Duomo and in a very nice area. The apartment is spacious and has a lovely little outside patio. However, the apartment is dirty, surfaces particularly in the kitchen and bathroom need a good cleaning, two coffee mugs that we took from the cupboard still had coffee rings around them and had been put back into the cupboard unwashed. Cristina did offer to send a cleaning lady to the apartment but we were leaving the following day and there didn't seem to be much point. There was no duvet cover for the one duvet, and despite mentioning this the day after our arrival, we never received one. The same with the caffetiere which was missing a handle. Again this was mentioned the day after our arrival but nothing was done. "
610985,61161085,2016-09-29T01:07:01Z,"Wonderful location. We could walk to the most important sites. Location was very safe next to the University of Florence. Cafes were conveniently located, grocery store down the street. Would definitely stay there again. Giuseppe and Cristina were extremely responsive and did everything as promised. "
610985,943040,2016-09-21T00:54:32Z,"The apartment is located about a 10 minute or less walk from the Duomo and the cathedral's dome can be seen from the sidewalk in front of the door.  The apartment itself is beautiful, with exquisite ceiling frescos throughout. We particularly appreciated the garden courtyard, where we enjoyed breakfasts. The flat was very spacious and with two bathrooms, felt almost like we were staying at a private home. Cristina left us a bottle of wine, which was a lovely touch and the apartment had great wi-fi in the front half, which I utilized frequently for uploading photos. It was also nice having the washing machine and a drying rack to hang our clothes on. I felt like a princess waking up in the canopy bed and looking up at the beautiful ceilings. Cristina's friendly property manager was there waiting when we arrived and spent ample time with us giving us recommendations and left us his cell phone number should we need anything at any time. Cristina was excellent at communication and checked in with us during our stay (since she could not be there to personally greet us). Her husband stopped by on check out day to replenish supplies and he was very friendly and gracious, as well. I would not hesitate to return any time and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good value and a beautiful apartment in Florence!!!"
610985,57529456,2016-07-06T02:07:12Z,Cristina was very accommodating. We were met on time and were able to check in early. The location is very good accessible to many of the local must see on foot. We enjoyed our visit very much
610985,42738743,2016-06-19T01:35:25Z,"Cristinas flat is in wonderful flo(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)an classy stile, combined with all modern Facilitys. Frescos in the ceiling, elegant stonefloor. The walls make it perfectly cool in the heat. Or you can sit in the small garden. Its also quit during the night. Cristina was all eyes-on fom the first contact til my stay was ended. Friendly, helpful and efficient. I was received by a very professionel member from her staff. Take a drink or a lunch at Hotel Four Seasons pool-bar and -restaurant. Its beautiful. Its classy. And the prices are quite reasonable. This flat reminds you every second of the great history of Firenze"
610985,10849678,2016-06-12T00:21:40Z,This apartment was absolutely charming and in a perfect location. Imagine our surprise when we arrived and looked down the street and saw the top of the Duomo shining in the sun! Just a short walk away and near everything we wanted to see and do. Christina was so helpful and concerned that we had everything we needed! She even scheduled a taxi for us for our very early morning departure! We could not have asked for a more helpful host. We hope to return again and would love to stay here again! 
610985,4090671,2016-06-07T00:47:09Z,"This is simply a fabulous apartment. From the ceiling frescoes to the lovely decor and the spacious rooms, it was exactly what we needed after long days sight-seeing in Florence. Best of all, it's in a quiet, chill part of down three blocks from the Galleria dell'Accademia (where you'll find Michelangelo's David) and it's also about a 10 minute walk to the Duomo. The other areas in Florence near these attractions seemed crowded and touristy, but our street/neighborhood was not. Best of all, there was a market in the nearby square on Sunday with wonderful Tuscan cheeses, wines, produce and breads being sold. Such a fabulous apartment and location!!"
610985,23778662,2016-05-31T00:44:36Z,Great place to stay to see the sights of Florence. We were checked in by Giuseppe who was great- our plane was delayed so arrived in the early hours of the morning and there were no issues with this- good communication throughout. 
610985,35128751,2016-05-27T02:56:18Z,"We had the most wonderful stay at Christina's apartment in Florence. Her communications were excellent, check in was easy and very helpful. The apartment was immaculate, and truly beautiful. 
Everything you could need is supplied. The apartment is amazingly central and yet so wonderfully quiet. The outside patio is lively with the Jasmine. I would recommend this apartment to anyone and I shall return very soon, I hope! 
Thank you Christina. "
610985,41354468,2016-05-23T02:34:17Z,"A warm welcome advised how to find the flat which was well situated for a few days in Florence. The flat, on the ground floor, was well maintained and benefitted from a private courtyard which was wonderful for the sunny days and its covering in jasmine produced an intoxicating smell at night. 
No washing stuff was provided so take your own and the kitchen facilities were basic but with so many good restaurants in Florence this should not be a problem! (There was a washing machine too but you will need to supply your own powder.)
Christina was very accommodating in providing a late check out as no new guests had booked in. I would recommend sorting this up front though. A useful hint is that The Four Seasons Hotel is next door which is a useful staging post for a quick drink and to get a taxi on the way to the airport ! (fixed price can work out cheaper than the airport bus)
All in all, a good stay in a relaxing environment away from the hot and hectic life of Florence and its tourists"
610985,21255818,2016-05-17T00:11:40Z,"My parents and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Cristina's apartment in Florence. The communication was clear and helpful both before and during our stay. We were met by Giuseppe, who was very friendly and helpful, showing us around the apartment and where everything was. He also offered to book a taxi for our departure to the airport; an offer we took him up on and proved very helpful indeed. 
The apartment was well located, taking less than 10 minutes to walk to The Duomo / Centre. It was spotlessly clean and tidy. The decoration was tasteful, the furnishings comfortable and the ceilings were beautifully decorated. Very comfortable space for the three of us. The apartment has character and charm. We also enjoyed sitting in the outdoor patio area, with morning coffee or pre dinner drinks. 
I have nothing but positive reviews for Cristina. We would stay with her again, should we ever return to Florence. And perhaps even make a trip to her horse riding stables next time! Thank you Cristina. "
610985,14304692,2016-05-09T02:01:47Z,"We did not meet Cristina but her agent Giuseppe was extremely helpful and we were able to book in early which was a great help to us and much appreciated. The apartment was as described, if anything it was better than the pictures show.  It was central to everything and really charming.  We would certainly stay here again if in Florence.  Many thanks Cristina."
610985,18964044,2016-05-03T03:31:28Z,"My sister and I loved staying in Cristina's apartment and wouldn't hesitate to book it again. The location is perfect as its right near the Duomo, you can see it from the front door, and  the street the apartment is on is nice and quiet. Its very tastefully decorated and very felt very large for the two of us. I would love to go back! "
610985,6843196,2016-04-11T00:29:51Z,"This apartment is exactly as described, and it is a wonderful home base for Florence. It is spacious, conveniently located, well equipped, and well decorated. The artwork on the walls and the ceiling decor are especially stunning. Very secure, with three locking doors and bars on the windows. Check in and check out were very easy."
610985,54887821,2016-02-16T14:56:50Z,"Loved the apartment and location! We could walk easily to everywhere in Florence. It was rainy and we were so glad to have a wonderful apartment to come home to....very cosy and welcoming. Couldn't have asked for a better place! Thank you, Cristina!"
610985,10992149,2016-01-05T14:05:09Z,"Cristina was a perfect host. Very clean, nice and cozy apartment in a quiet street but very close to everything and also to the largest gym of Florence. We really enjoyed our stay and will certainly come back soon to discover Tuscany and Florence in particular. Thank you Cristina."
7967975,23247596,2017-05-08T23:05:12Z,Awesome place! Beautiful view!
7967975,88393075,2017-05-06T18:06:51Z,Absolutely amazing experience. Lydia's place was stunning and exceeded all expectations. Highly recommend!
7967975,27477344,2017-05-05T16:21:11Z,"Lydia is very nice and beautiful 
And the house is amazing and this location 
I could very relax and detox 
But signal spot is tight"
7967975,107374244,2017-05-01T22:26:22Z,"beautiful night with the Christmas lights and a fire, but the sunrise is what makes it worth it! "
7967975,282957,2017-04-29T22:00:18Z,Awesome stay. Everything about it was perfect!
7967975,36678653,2017-04-28T21:11:02Z,all good .
7967975,123922059,2017-04-26T23:38:19Z,"We had a wonderful time! Beautiful location, so quiet and peaceful. Lydia was wonderful and very helpful. Gave great directions for getting there and everything was ready for us when we arrived. We just rested and relaxed during our short time there, but the hiking looked awesome! Would definitely return for some more R&R in this beautiful spot."
7967975,45431929,2017-04-20T15:04:53Z,"This place was excellent. We came to SoCal for the end of the wildflower bloom, and the beautiful cliff sides of topanga canyon were completely immersive. There's a beautiful small hiking trail next to this glamping paradise. I recommend renting a 4x4 vehicle as the driveway is steep and a sandy drive way. It helped us immensely.

The living spaces were comfortable. I haven't had a good nights sleep like that in a long time. The kitchen is adequate for small meals. There's also a propane grill! 

I would recommend this spot to anyone really looking to get away. It's secluded, comfortable, and everything we hoped for. Thank you Lydia and Raz!
"
7967975,11277168,2017-04-18T01:20:09Z,"Lydia has created a magical space at the top of the hill.  Multiple areas to laze about and take in the stunning views that Toponga has to offer. The kitchen trailer is well equipped and means if you bring suppliers you don't have any reason to leave! 

The bathroom is very basic. Exposed outdoor shower and long-drop toilet. But it adds to the charm and feel that you have escaped the rat race.

Although the location is secluded there is another Airbnb home directly underneath you and In order to access it people need to walk via your space.  So whilst your a million miles away you are not totally alone up on the hill. 

Highlight was watching the sun set and the place come alive with all the fairy lights. If you are keen to zen out and get back to basics then check this place out! "
7967975,121971682,2017-04-14T18:27:20Z,"You will love the view and peacefulness! The host, Lydia, was really nice and friendly with fast respons. There is everything including barbeque grill!! There is no electric sobprepare some candles or flash lights."
7967975,112016419,2017-04-13T17:43:37Z,Awesome place! Would stay again.
7967975,119377136,2017-04-11T16:15:49Z,Hike to the top. The view is worth the climb.
7967975,8580072,2017-04-09T17:06:07Z,"We had a great time at ""Top of the Hills"" in our two trailers. That is ""glamping"" at its best!  The trailers are perfectly equipped with everything you need. One trailer is the kitchen and the other trailer is a cozy bedroom and living room. The outdoor deck and BBQ is a fantastic place to chill out with amazing view over the Topanga hills. Lydia is great and did take care about everything. We checked in with Raz, a friend of Lydia as she was traveling and he was very nice and always at hand for questions. You need to be aware that theres an outdoor bathroom, toilet and open air shower which is no problem in warm weather. Our outside morning showers were a little bit chilly now in April but the water was running hot and it was fun. We loved to stay with Lydia and will surely come back again! A great place to stay in the wonderful nature of Topanga Canyon!"
7967975,25316116,2017-04-05T16:46:22Z,"If you haven't booked this place yet, book it. Just do it. The pictures don't do it justice. Lydias place is beyond gorgeous and exactly what my wife and I were looking for. No cell reception and away from everything. We were so bummed that we only stayed one night. One tip I must say is to make sure you bring fire wood for the fire pit and definitely have a night in. You have to experience the twinkle lights, fire, and stars at night. We can't wait to go back! "
7967975,60108546,2017-04-03T15:14:51Z,"This place is such a gem! Highly recommend this so-cal bohemian hideaway - still daydreaming about being fireside in deck day bed with boyfriend and dog, surrounded by stars and twinkling lights (pinch me - it was perfect!). Lydia is wonderful host. She ensured our getaway was both memorable and comfortable though out. Easily one of our favorite trips/experiences yet! "
7967975,23671420,2017-04-01T18:11:30Z,Everything was perfect:) 
7967975,12901967,2017-03-30T15:07:41Z,Really enjoyed our stay at Top of the Hill Acres. Such a unique location - Lydia has clearly put in so much time and effort to make this place special. 
7967975,113700753,2017-03-26T17:18:25Z,just PERFECT !
7967975,12161500,2017-03-25T17:18:08Z,"Staying at Lydia's place was a blast. It is simply the best. Peaceful, restful and inspiring. Spiritual at times. Embedded in nature, wonderfully decorated trailers. You have everything you need and more during this amazing glamping experience. The hosts are wonderful. They make you feel wonderful and welcomed. I did not not want to leave and will be back soon, I hope. "
7967975,53696605,2017-03-22T17:04:04Z,"Wonderful welcome, scenery and peaceful ""get away"" from the hustle and bustle yet super convenient for the city. Can't recommend enough- we will be back! "
6487879,15075602,2017-05-07T05:11:10Z,"Very nice location. Clean and comfortable!
Highly recommended."
6487879,101484244,2017-05-05T02:16:43Z,"Very clean, welcoming apartment located just minutes from a major subway stop, and within walking distance of the eastern portion of the French Concession. Centrally located to other attractions, as well.

Archer was gone, but his adorable dog kept me company. Super mellow and friendly.

Apartment itself is very clean and inviting. Housekeeper comes to turn the rooms between guests and let the dog out. Stunning views looking east towards Pudong. 

I recommend this to both single travelers as well as a pair or triplet of friends traveling together."
6487879,89235134,2017-05-02T06:41:02Z,最棒的应该是出地铁右拐就到家了 还有可以24小时播放的音响 夜景真真无敌٩(˃̶͈̀௰˂̶͈́)و
6487879,109546529,2017-04-29T08:41:14Z,"对位置的描述非常精准到位,省去了很多找房子时不必要的麻烦。房间收拾得干净整洁,装修偏性冷淡风,住起来非常舒服。很喜欢卧室带着的阳台,晚上出来吹吹风,欣赏一下上海的夜景,甚至可以跟好友喝酒聊天,简直是人生一大快事。还有一只超级超级可爱的小狗狗,一点都不怕人,听话又招人喜爱,最后check out的时候狗狗没在家感到好遗憾。另外房间离地铁站很近,去哪都很方便,而且旁边就是新天地,不愁吃吃逛逛没有好去处啦。总之是非常满意的一次入住体验,下次来上海还会选择这里。"
6487879,97733921,2017-04-26T02:07:46Z,"Great apartment with an awesome view! The room was very cozy and the bathroom very clean and tidy!  Archer & Benson are great host... 
in a nutshell great place to stay in Shanghai. "

6487879,7442047,2017-04-08T03:57:44Z,"Archer's place is in a great location. It's close to the train station, easy to get to other locations and is a 15 minute walk to Xintiandi. The view from his place is great!
The bathroom and room was nice and clean. I appreciated he left the heat on for us upon arrival. Communication was clear for check-in. I also appreciated that he had a washer and dryer that we could use. And it was nice of him to allow us to leave some things in his storage space while went to another location. His dog is cute. You may hear some music playing if you self check-in.. that is for the dog, while people are away. One issue was that there is a gateway and a guardman in front of the compound, and you could try just walking through when you first check-in, but we were stopped. My husband speaks some mandarin and was able to give him the address and explain we were guests, but if you do not speak the language that could be an issue. Other than that comment, it's a great place to stay. Thanks Archer!"
6487879,105290154,2017-04-05T03:12:57Z,"第一次在airbnb上预订,体验很好,首先地理位置优越,地铁口就在附近一百米左右,前有新天地后有豫园,去哪都很方便。而且阳台的夜景不要太美啊!两位房东都很热情,还有一头特别乖的小白梗,一点也不怕生,会翻过小肚皮让你抚摸,在这里两天感觉很好~下次会再来~"
6487879,30440668,2017-03-13T03:03:13Z,"位置超级好!去新天地什么的走着就到了哈哈哈~然后房东啊保洁阿姨啊狗狗啊都很棒。狗狗特别亲人,老扭来扭去求摸摸\(////)\"

6487879,38923496,2017-02-10T03:43:26Z,The location is great! Convenient to Xintiandi and the Bund. The room was very clean and everything worked well. And the puppy is cute.
6487879,13537250,2017-02-08T03:29:36Z,Archer's place is great.  Convenient to get around. Very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Archer is a great host. He was very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend

같이 집에서 사는 것 치고는 괜찮았는데

그리고 화장실 배수구가 잘 안내려가서요^^

좋은건 강아지가 귀엽습니다...
담에는 홑텔로 갑니다"
6487879,107135903,2016-12-23T00:34:34Z,Great stay! Would stay there again
8769074,98742606,2017-05-07T04:23:31Z,"2 of the areas regarding the flat were very disappointing. First, one of the rooms (Room A) is located exactly at the passenge between the living room and room B. It means our friend who stayed at Room A has no privacy and in case anyone from Room B walked out it will wake him up. Additiomally there is also no air conditioning for Room A. Secondly, the beddings for two of the rooms are very low quality which reminded us of 1 to 2 star hostel. Basically they are very hard and you can physically feel the springs umderneath the bedding. Anyway Dwyane is a friendly host and very responsive. We have to admit that the living room is luxuriously spacious and we have chilled and enjoyed our moments."
8769074,82958050,2017-05-04T01:34:33Z,"1. Oppa is super nice host and he can speaks multi-language!
2. Location is super good just 5 seconds walking distance from subway station.
3. The apartment is spacious & good looking. We can hang out and drink at the bar table.
4. Highly recommended!"
8769074,107595749,2017-05-04T01:27:34Z,"가족들끼리 묵기 좋은 숙소였습니다
다만 소파가 커서그런 지 거실이 사진보다는 좁더라구요 그래도 단체로 묵기에 좋고 무엇보다 역세권에 9호선 급행열차가 정차하는 역이라 여기저기 이동하기도 정말 편해요"
8769074,40267245,2017-05-01T03:35:35Z,"地點十分方便,出地鐵站僅一分鐘內路程,屋內環境舒適,空間十分大,而Dwyane亦很有耐性解答每次的問題,我和朋友們都十分滿意!"

8769074,10730771,2017-04-16T23:34:59Z,"Great location, just right Next to the subway station. And also close to the famous bar and nightclub in Seoul. Clean and accurate info. Perfect for family or bunch of friends if traveling together. Also, the host Dwyane is super helpful and replies quickly on all the qs we had.

A great experience if you are willing to live a Gangnam Style holiday!!! Highly recomended :) "
8769074,26200973,2017-04-05T00:53:55Z,"Our family of 5 was easily accommodated in the apartment.  The views were great.

Dwayne's apartment is in a really good location right above the Bongeunsa tube station and the Coex mall with lots of nice restaurants around.  It was very close to the Bonguensa Buddhist temple which we recommend visiting along with the olympic Park which we enjoyed cycling around as a family.

The apartment is really nice and is great value.  Dwayne was really helpful and accommodating.  I can't recommend it enough."
8769074,101888595,2017-04-02T02:16:32Z,"위치와 방의 꾸밈은 정말 좋았습니다.

Uns hat es wirklich gut bei Dale gefallen.

4646142,38847341,2017-05-08T12:38:39Z,"Perfect house for two persons, everything is available in the house, full kitchen, wasmachine and dryer. And safe and free parking in front of the house. Just a 10 to 15 minute walk to the V&A waterfront, were al lot of restaurants, bars, shops and other tourist stuff are, like the hop on and off bus. Also a short drive to the table mountain, Lions head, ( both beautiful hikes.) I would recconment this place. We have stayed here for 6 days. So for short and longer stays, this is a Good place. "

Its location is fantastic - central to everything, with all the necessary eateries and grocery stores just minutes' walk away.  Dale was very responsive throughout my stay, and also very respectful of his guests' privacy.  Nonetheless, he did make it a point to come by and say hi towards the end of our stay, and I am very glad we got to meet him as he was very sweet :-).  I will recommend Dale's to anyone visiting Cape Town in a heartbeat, and will definitely pick Dale's abode again when I return!  Many thanks for the wonderful experience!"
4646142,16250289,2017-03-29T06:53:04Z,We have had a grat time in Dales Apartment... the Apartment has everything you need and more :) for Sure we will come back
4646142,71137411,2017-03-25T09:33:11Z,"Dales place was clean, comfy and he communicated with us on check in and getting our keys very thoroughly. We really liked having the gated parking and easy convenience to major roads in capetown. I would definitely stay here again! "
4646142,53218584,2017-03-22T06:24:09Z,"We had a awesome stay in Cape Town! The Apartment is perfectly located, very very clean, lovingly and stylishly equipped and parking space infront of the door. Dale is a perfect host, bringing us flowers at our arrival day. Thanks for all!"
4646142,32748282,2017-03-16T08:18:49Z,"We spent four days in Dale's Brynterion Cottage. I am a wheelchair user and I can say that the accessibility is quite good! The parking spot is very tiny though, it was a little bit tough to get in and out the car. The apartment itself is beautiful and there's much light. The bed is very comfortable. The kitchen is fully equipped and very clean. The bathroom is big and bright but the shower isn't completely suitable for wheelchair users. Everything is well arranged, nice and clean. There's no air-conditioning, but you can open the big front door as well as a small window near the bed. The surroundings are perfect. There's everything you need within a short walking distance. The hills are very steep tough and wheelchair users need help or, even better, a car. We had a great time in Dale's place and can definitely recommend it!"
4646142,16666658,2017-03-12T09:23:03Z,"The apartment is located very centrally directly above the stadium and V&A waterfront. It is nicely decorated has a comfy bed and everything was very clean! Surrounding area was quiet and secure.
Thank you so much Dale! "
4646142,3278254,2017-03-11T08:33:17Z,"Dale was a fantastic host, easily contactable and helpful at all points. The apartment was perfect for us, a young couple. Everything we needed, clean, great decor, perfect for four nights in a great location that was walkable to V&A waterfront. Highly recommendable. "
4646142,12463730,2017-03-07T07:43:31Z,A fantastic appartment where the host has catered for not only what you need - but everything. Good central location and no noise at nighttime. Can highly recommend Dale and his appartment. 
4646142,20096323,2017-03-02T08:55:18Z,Beautifully furnished studio! Home away from home. Love how close the restaurants are and also great runs to Seapoint. Fabulous!!!

457728,89515064,2017-04-20T09:05:32Z,"Ich möchte an dieser Stelle Claudia und Max für ihre tolle Unterkunft und die super Kommunikation danken. Schon im Vorfeld hat die Kommunikation super geklappt. Max hat mir ein paar Tage vor Anreise alle nötigen Information zugesendet. Eine Karte für die Autofahrt und Tipps für den richtigen Weg.
Während unseres Aufenthaltes waren Claudia und Max immer per (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) erreichbar und haben uns mit Rat und Tat und guten Tipps geholfen, unseren Sardinien Urlaub zu einem tollen Erlebnis zu machen.
Vielen Dank und wir würden jederzeit wieder dort Urlaub machen. Ciao"
457728,19016544,2017-04-11T08:15:55Z,"L'appartement de Massimiliano est un très beau spot, à proximité des commerces et proche de la plage. 
Nous avons passé un bon séjour."
457728,12148199,2017-04-07T07:18:57Z,"Our stay at Claudias and Max' Apartment was a pleasure! Both are very helpful and caring, either in the communications before the arrival and while staying in their apartment they are really caring. The house is very clean and spacious and well equipped. The area around the house is very beautiful, you can do a lot of things around there and the beach is stunning. I would really recommend staying at Claudias and Max' apartment and in the future I am absolutely planning to go back there. Huge thank you to the host for the wonderful stay! "
457728,30949712,2017-04-03T07:51:41Z,"This apartment has everything you need, ideal with a singular sense of wellbeing."
457728,40862596,2016-11-11T02:04:49Z,"We were drawn to Max and Claudia's property as it looked bright and modern. We were not disappointed. The place is absolutely lovely. Bright, clean and comfortable. Our hosts were also very good at communicating with us on our arrival and very helpful in suggesting places to visit. They also left us some lovely treats "
457728,23333042,2016-10-02T00:54:26Z,"- alles ok
- telefonisch gut erreichbar
- Getränke und Früchte im Kühlschrank bei Ankunft

457728,37903802,2016-09-27T03:17:38Z,"Massimiliano and Claudia were very helpfull by giving information before as well as during our stay in their appartment. There were fruits and drinks as a welcome. Very nice! 
The appartment is a perfect place for a couple to stay. It is situated in an older building that has been recently, tastfully renovated. Shops and restaurants are on walking distance, also is the beach. For a longer stay it is great to have the washing machine and an oven. First needs are in the appartment at arrival, which made the arrival very relaxed. On the walls are great pictures from Maximilliano; carefully chosen compositions and colours. 
We had beautiful wheather during the two weeks of our stay in SM Navarrese, 28/30 degrees with a nice seawind.  The environment is of a rough beauty: on our route to Dorgali (Grotta di Ispinigoli) we met donkeys, horses, wild swines and sheep on the way. Not without danger! 
We had great holidays and we sure can recommand the place to everybody!"
457728,51609652,2016-09-13T02:47:38Z,"Massimiliano and Claudia were very welcoming to us even though we arrived late. Everything was beautiful and there was fruit when we arrived and everything we needed for the beach. They were super helpful at every opportunity! The house is really relaxed with some great photography. The village is perfect with great restaurants and beaches. We had great stay, perfect for our restful honeymoon. Thank you!"
457728,10065385,2016-09-03T00:43:33Z,It was a fantastic stay. The flat is beautiful and perfectly equipped. We were welcomed with fruit and drinks and felt at home. Massimiliano had great tipps where to travel or eat. We absolutely enjoyed our time in Santa Maria Navaresse which is a pretty spot and a good place to explore the area. 
457728,43764736,2016-08-27T03:50:35Z,"We felt very welcome and we're greeted by Massimiliano's mother and Claudia was always accessible on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) if we had any questions. The neighbourhood had a nice community spirit and we enjoyed the restaurants and beaches. We would recommend having a car to get to other beaches. Some beaches also needed access by boat. Apartment was very spacious and had plenty of room.
They supplied us with things for the beach like an umbrella, mats and flippers for example, which saved us having to buy it ourselves. 
Overall a great stay and lovely beaches. "
457728,53266539,2016-08-22T01:38:46Z,Claudia and Max are friendly hosts and supported us where they can to make our stay wonderful. The appartment is beautiful and as described on the platform. We had a great time.
457728,53742287,2016-08-08T03:08:13Z,"L'appartement est idéalement situé ( proximité du centre du village et de la plage ) et aménagé avec beaucoup de  goût. Massimiliano et Claudia ont pensé à tous les petits détails ( sèche-cheveux, fer à repasser, prise adaptateur pour appareils électriques , prise anti-moustiques ...... ) pour vous rendre le séjour agréable. L'accueil de Vanna était agréable et discret. Le seul (!) petit bémol est la proximité entre le  balcon de l'appartement du dessus et les deux fenêtres principales de notre appartement pour des raisons sonores. Merci à nos hôtes,  nous reviendrons très certainement."
457728,1383846,2016-08-03T11:22:19Z,"Wir haben uns sehr willkommen gefühlt. Würden schön empfangen mit frischen Obst und kalten Getränken. Haben jede menge Tolle Tipps bekommen was wir alles machen können. Der Strand war auch super , vor allem zum Schnorchel. Sehr gute Lokalisation, können überall zu Fass laufen. Sehr Leckere Gelateria gleich um die Ecke! Und für Kinder auch ein Tolles Spielplatz. Wir empfehlen sehr die unterkunft."
457728,49080165,2016-07-24T01:11:23Z,"We spent part of our honeymoon in Massimiliano's apartment in Santa Maria Navarese and it was just perfect. Communication was smooth before and during our stay, the apartment clean and it had everything we needed. We warmly recommend Massimiliano as host and the apartment for a Holiday!"
457728,26399447,2016-07-16T02:38:00Z,"Wir hatten eine wunderbare und erholsame Zeit. Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und modern. Wir haben uns von Anfang an sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Küche ist gut ausgerüstet. Wir haben sie jedoch kaum genutzt, da wir jeden Tag essen waren. Die Aufteilung der Wohnung ist sehr gut. Im unteren Teil befindet sich das Schlafzimmer, das schöne Bad und eine kleine begehbare Kammer mit Kleiderschrank. Alles in allem, wir möchten gerne wieder kommen.
Meryem und Ivo"
457728,30957867,2016-07-02T00:57:14Z,"We were give very clear directions to the apartment and were welcomed by our hosts' mother who had just finished cleaning it. It was spotlessly clean. The flat is spacious and cool (air conditioning only in the living area on the upper floor but the bedroom and bathroom on the lower floor were shaded from the day's heat) and  has everything you need, including a fully fitted kitchen area, and sunshade mats and chairs for the beach which is a short stroll downhill. Restaurants, cafes and shops are nearby. "
457728,23389004,2016-06-26T03:06:35Z,"Wir hatten eine sehr schöne Zeit bei Massimiliano und Claudia. Bei unserer Ankunft wurden wir herzlich von Claudia empfangen und erhielten wertvolle Tipps (Strände, Ausflüge etc.). Claudia war jederzeit für uns ansprechbar und hat uns bei einem massiven Problem mit unserem Mietwagen sehr weitergeholfen. Ohne sie hätten wir das Problem vielleicht nicht lösen können. Danke Claudia! 
Das Appartment ist sehr gut ausgestattet und enthält alles was für einen schönen entspannten Aufenthalt benötigt wird. Das Appartment ist sehr gelegen. Rund um das Appartment sind mehrere Restaurants, Strand, Hafen und Supermärkte fußläufig erreichbar. 
Sollten wir noch mal Urlaub auf Sardinien machen (was sehr wahrscheinlich ist), würden wir jederzeit wieder kommen :-)."
457728,2048505,2016-06-13T02:36:14Z,"This apartment was perfect in so many ways!  It is squeaky clean, is well equipped with a washer which is such a bonus when travelling, it stays cool in the heat of the day, has parking right out front, has two levels so you feel like you can get some separation, it is well equipped for cooking at home but you are within walking distance of several decent restaurants, and the pebble beach a few blocks away is beautiful!  You can rent a lounger on the beach for the full day for only 6 euros and you can come and go.  The marina at the Port, also within walking distance, has boat excursion opportunities for experiencing the magnificent coast which allows you to see all the stunning beaches you read about - we opted to book a zodiac with a private skipper through Nautica so we could dictate the length of time for stops and where we wanted to go - worth every cent and will remain one of the highlights of our trip! Claudia was delightful to deal with - warm and welcoming and responded immediately to all our inquiries.  She thoughtfully left some items in the fridge for breakfast along with some drinks. I can't rave enough about this place so if you are looking for something in Santa Maria Navaresse snap this one up!  You won't regret it."
4733684,2027685,2017-05-07T11:04:32Z,"The apartment was very clean, comfortable with awesome views and easy walkable beachfront access. Very cool modern decor and fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. Street parking was easily available and on the other side of the street from the building. Stairs to the apartment were not a problem for us but could be for unfit guests with heavy luggage. Ernst was a great host. I highly recommend this place."
4733684,127031836,2017-05-03T11:39:22Z,"Nice, clean, modernwalking distance to camps bay and 2 min walk to Ckifton beach."
4733684,3780428,2017-04-24T08:46:14Z,"Ernst's apartment was simply stunning.  The location close to Clifton beach and various attractions and amenities was incredible, the apartment itself was safe, and attractive with everything you would expect and the sunset was better than any photo can do justice.  Ernst and his family was super helpful in settling us in and going above and beyond.  I would definitely recommend a stay there if you're in Cape Town. "
4733684,57345841,2017-04-18T05:08:34Z,What an amazing view and the apartment is just beautiful. 
4733684,61128295,2017-04-14T09:28:08Z,"Great place and great location
Ernst is an excellent host and extremely friendly and accommodating 

Highly recommend the property "
4733684,16931071,2017-04-07T07:53:41Z,"As previous reviews may attest, this property is phenomenal. Great views from the apartment, within close proximity to Clifton beach, clean/modern apartment with all appliances you may need for your stay. If you find yourself short of supplies, there is a market close by so that was very convenient. Many restaurants available by Camps Bay, which is a 4 minute Uber ride or 20 minute walk.  Uber readily available at all hours. The neighborhood is safe and peaceful. 

This is not a bait and switch property, you get what is advertised and more. Host Ernst was always available to answer any questions. No arrogance or impatience, pure class.  "
4733684,5953050,2017-04-03T06:12:20Z,We had an amazing stay at Ernst's apartment. It was everything we could have hoped for and more. Perfect home base for exploring Cape Town and beautiful scenic views of the ocean. It is near by to many great neighbourhoods with shops and restaurants. Would recommended to anyone!
4733684,98211346,2017-03-31T08:59:39Z,"Amazing location, quaint, stylish...I have seriously run out of superlatives! For a fun weekend as a couple, there cannot possible be a more perfect accomodation and location in this city. Thank you very much Ernst!"
4733684,120035950,2017-03-28T08:35:45Z,"A fantastic apartment in a really central location with easy access to camps bay, sea point, green point and the V&A waterfront. Each one of Clifton's 4 beaches can be accessed within a 5 minute walk.
The apartment was extremely clean and exactly as described in photos and the description. 
The apartment is located on Victoria road and can get a little noisy during the day, but the Double glazed windows cut out a lot of the noise and make it a very comfortable stay. 
The only parking is off street, so practice your parallel parking before arriving. We stayed here in March 2017 and there was always parking available relatively close to the apartment. 
A great apartment with even better views, magnificent sunsets and even a chance to spot a whale or two (as we did on one day). "
4733684,100145504,2017-03-24T09:38:37Z,"This is a fantastic spot for a low key beach trip. Within walking distance to a grocery store and great restaurants.

The rental was immaculate and the host was incredibly accessible. 

 

"
4733684,94507203,2017-03-20T06:45:01Z,We really enjoyed our stay in this lovely modern apartment with beautiful views of the ocean. The furnishings are of a high standard and are very comfortable. The apartment is well equipped and very clean.  Netflix is a plus. The location is nice as Clifton 3rd Beach is within walking distance. The apartment is situated on the main beach road but the traffic noise is not bad if you close the windows. Our host Ernst was very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend this apartment.
4733684,35125944,2017-03-18T09:41:10Z,"We had an unforgettable time at Ernst's apartment. He was a great host and responded to all our queries immediately. And the apartment itself - well, you have to see it for your own eyes to believe how beautiful it is with the best views over Clifton beaches. I wish we could stay longer and what can I say more - we will be back for sure! Thank you Ernst!"
4733684,30203741,2017-03-09T00:43:38Z,"This studio apartment is well finished and furnished in an upscale manner. Ernst is a great host, friendly and responsive. "
4733684,14951691,2017-02-09T07:18:10Z,"The apartment is as advertised and the mix of reviews here are largely accurate.
Pluses: Ernst is a responsive and and professional host who clearly takes his hosting responsibilities seriously.  When I needed an iron because the one in the apartment was not working, he arranged to have one delivered within a few hours. He helped me lug my many bags up the stairs.  There is no elevator and the apartment unit is in a third floor walk-up.

Minuses:  the apartment building is in a part of Clifton which is off the main drag.  It's easily accessible by uber and taxi but don't expect to walk across the street to grab a cup of coffee every morning.

The south facing windows look directly onto the Atlantic, access to which is across the street.  This makes for spectacular views but a hot interior during the day - even with the air condition unit on full blast.

Finally, the unit does not have a parking spot, which would be problematic if, like me, you needed to rent a vehicle on short notice.
Ernst, being the problem solver he is, was trying to come up with a work-around on the parking but given the short notice, was unable to.
All in all, a great experience and would recommend."
4733684,24104560,2017-02-05T06:52:47Z,Das Apartment war sehr sauber und entsprach der Beschreibung. Ernst war stets erreichbar und zuvorkommend. 
4733684,108443793,2017-01-22T06:11:49Z,We had such a great time! We wished we owned the place. Thank you so much Ernst. 
4733684,51033809,2017-01-18T09:17:41Z,"X 

A lot of things have been said and 
all of them completly true. Stunning 
view, SUPER modern apartment a perfect Place to watch the ocean, unforgettable sunsets or to have breakfast with a breathtaking views.
Everything you needed is here 
even netflix and a dishwasher

Lauren gave us a very warm welcome 
and showed us everything. She 
is really a nice person and gave us the 
feeling that we could easily contact her 
if we need help (Ernst was also in touch to make sure we sorted and to see if there is anything we need)

We would love and probably will come again and recommend Lauren and Ernst appartment Highly."

4733684,493196,2017-01-06T02:16:26Z,Beautiful place.
4733684,46408788,2017-01-02T01:28:20Z,Beautiful place few steps from beach with gorgeous views of ocean. Modern yet comfortable and well equipped with all the amenities. We were very happy. It's on a busy road and parking can be challenge so best to use Uber. Many of the places are within walking distance though. 
107051,120355430,2017-05-05T07:40:25Z,"다른나라 여행중 보트에서 생활을 해볼수 있는 색다른 경험을 원하는 사람들에게는 괜찮은 숙소입니다.
좁고 조금은 불편하긴 하지만 여행의 한부분으로서 해볼만한 도전입니다. 그리고 호스트와의 약속시간은 정확히 지켜서 도착하시는게 좋습니다."
107051,113109119,2017-05-02T08:44:35Z,Highly recommended for an alternative experience in London. Meg was a great host - very accommodating and made sure we were as comfortable as possible. We enjoyed every minute on board.
107051,107742410,2017-04-30T09:40:40Z,Location is great; views along the canal are very nice.
107051,52495844,2017-04-27T07:49:31Z,Staying on a boat was a very fun and unique way to experience London.  The area is very beautiful.  Sleeping on the boat is so relaxing as well.  I would definitely recommend staying on The Jessie! 
107051,2615674,2017-04-25T15:18:14Z,Amazing few days on Megs longboat! Restful comfortable and close to public transport and restaurants / groceries. Highly recommend 
107051,27041443,2017-04-23T10:41:26Z,"We had a lovely stay.  The boat was quiet, comfortable, very well equipped and convenient for Paddington.  The children loved it.  Thank you Meg."
107051,29167408,2017-04-21T09:07:59Z,"Fantastic location, 5 mins from tube, quiet location in a beautiful part of the city."
107051,108619182,2017-04-17T07:34:46Z,It's a wonderful boat and located in a oeac full place so close to public transportation. 
107051,102557841,2017-04-14T08:46:19Z,"Unser Aufenthalt war einfach großartig. Das Kanalboot liegt traumhaft schön in Little Venice. Bis zur Undergroundstation sind es nur 5 Minuten und von dort aus ist man gleich im Zentrum.
In unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft befinden sich Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten.
Alles war sauber und genauso wie beschrieben. Wir haben uns gleich wohl gefühlt. Sogar Tee, Kaffee, Milch, Eier, Marmelade und ein Obstkorb waren bereits vorhanden. Meg ist eine sehr herzliche Gastgeberin, die jederzeit mit Hilfe zur Verfügung steht. 
Es war eine unvergessliche Reise für uns."
107051,12479669,2017-04-11T00:39:24Z,"Jessie must be one of the best places to stay when visiting London. A very special experience. Comfortable, clean and in a fantastic location. Meg is a great host. When we arrived Meg provided us with lots of fresh fruit, milk and breakfast provisions and there was even a bunch of fresh flowers. The area is a peaceful place to return to after a hectic day of sightseeing but it is also within easy walking distance to public transport, restaurants, bars and cafe. We can't wait to book our next stay on Jessie. "
107051,104738999,2017-04-07T07:49:39Z,Our stay on Jessie was amazing. The location is a short walk to Paddington station and the experience of the boat was well worth the journey. Jessie is well equiped with everything that we needed. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and the beds are comfortable.
107051,17110470,2017-04-03T09:43:00Z,I was looking for a house and found a boat.  I highly recommend this unique way of seeing London and will rent it again if I go back and it's available.  Thanks Meg
107051,69813371,2017-03-28T09:38:35Z,"Such a fantastic boat that add the incomparable experience for our trip in London.
Meg is very nice to prepare everything we need for staying in besides the perfect beautiful boat herself. All little tricks about living on board have been told and nothing is unsatisfying.
Comfortable and immaculate conditions, chic decoration, unique living circumstances makes JESSIE a perfect choice when considering both a brief and long stay. Everything you have to know is already on the website information.
Sincerely thank you for hosting us dear Meg!"
107051,93819245,2017-03-26T10:10:50Z,"Our stay in Jessie was very relaxing, near by shops, restaurants and pubs were plentiful and good, we were made really welcome
Meg was the best hostess ever, the boat was clean and really comfortable with some lovely surprise extras such as flowers a big bowl of fruit, milk, butter, croissants - everything you could think you would need was supplied and more she is a very friendly and generous hostess "
107051,6782076,2017-03-22T11:10:55Z,"My family of 4 had a wonderful vacation in London.  Meg's boat was perfect for us and probably the most memorable experience of our vacation.  The location was convenient.  We flew into Heathrow, took the 15 minute Heathrow Express to Paddington Station, and the boat is an easy 10 minute walk from the station.  Meg stocked the kitchen with fruit, yogurt, cereal, juice, milk, eggs, croissants, jam, cookies and every condiment that you need.   We saved so much money being able to eat breakfast on the boat and make sandwiches for supper.  I cannot recommend Meg or the boat enough."
107051,104889746,2017-03-04T10:07:32Z,"We had a great time, the boat was a special experience in a lovely location! "
107051,10696688,2017-02-27T11:24:21Z,"Meg is the most wonderful host you can imagine. Check In and Out were perfect, breakfast was delicious and Meg`s recommendations were more than helpful. Jessie is very well equipped and a fantastic accomodation in London - we will come back for sure and can highly recommend Jessie to the airbnb community."
107051,13824559,2017-02-24T09:22:28Z,"We had a wonderful stay on Jessie, both my husband and I and our two children loved every minute. Jessie is exactly as described in the photos and was a perfect base for our trip to London. We were staying on Jessie when Storm Doris hit and we were perfectly warm and cosy with the log burning stove lit. My daughter loved it so much she cried when we had to leave! "
107051,107782512,2017-01-29T11:58:43Z,Meg was amazing and was very knowledgeable. The location of the boat was great and close to many restaurants and shops. Was only a 20 min walk to portobello market aswell which was really cool. Would definitely recommend staying here and can't wait to stay here again in the future. Richard and beth x 
107051,56245880,2017-01-22T09:21:02Z,We stayed over one of the coldest weekends in January - the canal was frozen! - but we lit the stove and it kept the boat toasty all night long.
744649,62201240,2017-04-29T09:34:12Z,"Excellent stay! Room and bathroom towards the back of the apartment so pretty private. The only one who comes to visit is the very friendly cat, who FYI knows how to push open the door... Be aware for midnight visits! Francis provided tea, coffee, biscuits, water, and basic crockery and cutlery in the room. There was also a fridge and microwave in the next room,  and with a grocery store just across the road, it was very convenient to eat a few meals at ""home"". Apartment is in a great location with an excellent bakery just next door and loads of shops and restaurants down the road. Also the metro station is a few meters from the front door, and some great locations are within walking distance too. Francis is retired and always available to chat or offer some advice. Note that he smokes so there is a faint odour but it never troubled me. Occasionally there was some music or noise from outside but never very loud or for very long, i.e. the room is nice and quiet. Overall it was an exceptional stay and I would happily stay there again. "
744649,106789563,2017-04-17T09:23:38Z,Fantastic stay with a great host in a very accessible area. Good food near by and right beside the metro stop. 
744649,68709437,2017-04-14T06:21:31Z,"Incredibly nice and welcoming hosts, really can't overstate that. They have a great selection of books they let me read. Metro is right outside the entrance, and it's a very central station too (at most I had to change two lines to get to any touristy / central location or CDG). Also they have the best cat I've ever met (too fluffy). 13/10 it's a good stay brent."
744649,60024567,2017-04-04T09:47:46Z,"Francis is a great host, he allowed me to have early check in and have shower when my arrival time as early in the morning (although finally I didn't do it). Also warm welcome together with his cute cat. On last day, he also allowed me to leave my back until late in the afternoon. Giod value that I also can wash my clothes before leaving and continue my long trip to another place. Great!"
744649,33636328,2017-03-31T09:46:15Z,Great location by metro station with easy access to the rest of the city. Very comfortable room with a good bathroom and amenities. Great hosts very kind and helpful. I would repeat the experience with them and the charming Titan 
744649,43335479,2017-03-25T07:47:14Z,Frances is an excellent host...he gave me and my husband two sets of keys to the apartment which was very practical...the size of the room is more than you get in a 3 star hotel...the bathroom and bedroom are highly private and Francis offered us the use of a fridge and microwave....the metro is located just outside the door to the apartment....the only downside is that the area is not the most tranquil in Paris...otherwise it is in a very central location...
744649,5683816,2017-03-17T08:47:11Z,Merci Francis et Veronique. I enjoyed my stay. Thank you for everything. 
744649,686429,2017-03-12T07:55:53Z,"I saw some great reviews on Airbnb, and I was not disappointed when I got there. It is a lovely apartment, and Francis made us feel at home immediately. He gave us a tour and showed us clearly what amenities were at our disposal. He was never intrusive, and was very glad to help when we had questions about the city. A very warm atmosphere, and the living room was so magnificent! Thanks so much for giving us a great experience in Paris, Francis."
744649,80675441,2017-03-08T09:08:11Z,"Nice, seperate room and bath, great location. And thanks for the table tennis games : )"
744649,53908061,2017-03-01T09:57:55Z,"It was surely a great choice to stay in Paris. 
Great location 
Friendly Francis and two lovely little cats. 
Clean
I just so love Francis sweet home. 
"
744649,106171419,2017-02-22T07:20:37Z,Francis is a kind man who made our stay very comfortable. We couldn't be happier with his service. 
744649,18229255,2017-02-15T07:55:49Z,Francis was definitely a very gracious host! He gave us many recommendations and wonderful conversations. The place is also just as cute and quaint as the pictures! The place is also extremely close to the metro-- literally right outside the door. Will definitely stay here again! 
744649,50910609,2017-02-09T09:28:06Z,"Very nice, clean,quite place,
Amazing location from the Metro, and only 10mins to Pompidou centre.
Also Gare du nord is very close to the house.
If I have chance to go Paris again, I'd love to stay this house again!"
744649,73294175,2017-01-30T10:30:27Z,"I've recently returned from a stay here with my 18 year old daughter and the choice was perfect. We needed a central base close to transport links and walking distance to cafes, bars, coffee shops etc and we had this in abundance plus across the street is an excellent supermarket. 
The bedroom and bathroom are at the back of the apartment so very quiet and private plus there is use of a fridge.
Francis was the perfect host who always engaged in genuine and helpful conversation and made us feel very comfortable.
And finally the larger than life star of the visit Titan who made our trip home from home a very big thank you.

744649,58274364,2017-01-19T07:05:09Z,"The location of the apartment is very convenient. Just 1 min walk to the metro station and can get you to any major spots to the city. The room is as described, enjoying hot bath every night.
Francis is very nice and also his social cat - Titan. Looking forward to be here next time.
"
744649,69526085,2017-01-17T01:38:23Z,"This place was great! The location is right next to a metro station which made it easier to get to most touristic places. There are a lot of shops and restaurants as you come out of the house! The room was very comfortable and Francis was very welcoming and helpful when recommending places to visit. Also, it was great that him and Veronique spoke English very well!! I recommend it!!"
744649,74121459,2017-01-10T02:45:58Z,"We had a pleasant stay in Paris, the house is as described and very beautiful and the room is more spacious than it looks. It has a useful table with dishes, cutlery and an extensive tea and coffee set in the room. We really did love the piano room too but didn't want to spend too much time there and intrude. 
Francis is a very nice man and helped us quite a bit and has a lovely cat named Titan who is super affectionate. It is a  nice listing and pretty close to the city. I would recommend for people who want a nice home base to explore the louvre end of the city and nearby suburbs from."
744649,107981331,2017-01-02T09:10:40Z,"The house and room were exactly the same as the pictures on airbnb. The room and private bathroom for guests were very clean and warm even for freezing weather. It's right in front of a metro station, so it's convenient to go anywhere in Paris. If the weather is warm, I'd recommend you to walk instead of using metro. Walkable distance to Louvre and Le Marais. Most importantly, you'll be able to meet the kindest host, Francis, and the most friendly cat, Titan. Once you arrive, he will kindly explain about the home. If you have questions about Paris before traveling, ask the sweet Parisian guy. He will be willing to answer for your questions and help you a lot."
744649,81206606,2016-12-28T09:31:40Z,"Francis was a fantastic host and his cat, Titan, is adorable. The apartment is stunning - over 500 years old, and I really enjoyed playing the grand piano. Francis provided orange juice and coffee in the mornings, as well as having a Nespresso maker in our bedroom. We could also cook in his kitchen. Most apartments in Paris only have showers, so having a full-sized bathtub was wonderful. There are lots of great restaurants and brasseries in the area, and it's an easy 20 minute walk to the Seine. Sights such as St Eustache Church (the largest in Paris), the Pompidou Centre and Forum Les Halles are close by and well worth a visit."
744649,66016616,2016-12-19T01:43:54Z,"A superb apartment conveniently located right next to metro station so great for easy access to all Paris. Right on a bustling street but you can't hear anything. Excellent host who lives at the apartment and couldn't do enough for me. So kind and helpful and very sociable. He (and his cat Titan! ) made me feel at home straight away. 
Just be aware the owner smokes (cigars/pipe) which didn't bother me but might if you are anti smoking. 
Highly recommend this place and I will hopefully be staying again in the future 
"
933482,23270968,2017-04-27T20:25:27Z,"We loved Shane and Maru's condo! It was exactly as described in the listing and the view was amazing. Our host was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. Checkin and checkout was a breeze. The only thing to keep in mind, that it's not exactly walking distance to south beach but the part of the beach it's located on was just as nice and a little more private. Southbeach was a quick 5 minute uber ride away. I am definitely looking forward to staying here again. "
933482,121153301,2017-04-23T14:29:34Z,The room as well as the host were very profesional and polite. I couldn't of asked for a better stay.
933482,36674124,2017-04-22T15:27:08Z,"Shane and Maru were excellent hosts to a beautiful apartment. They were very accommodating and respond quickly any time we needed to reach out. To put it short they set you up for a very relaxing and fun trip! Thank you Shane and Maru, looking forward to our next trip back!"
933482,69104874,2017-04-13T14:58:37Z,"I stayed at Shane & Maru's condo with my two kids ages 6 and 4 months. Everything was great. Check in and out was a breeze. The room was exactly as pictured. Very clean and fresh smelling. The building offers a hotel feel with the number of amenities offered. We took advantage of the beach each day of our stay. We found the chairs, umbrella and towels offered to be perfect. My 6 year old loved the sand toys as well. I believe the true measure of how great your host is evident when something goes awry and they have to respond. We dealt with an AC snafu. I notified Shane & Maru through the app, and they dispatched maintenance super quick. No hassel at all. "
933482,69723621,2017-04-10T13:19:13Z,Everything was wonderful! Look just like the picture. The view is to die for! 
933482,57291150,2017-04-09T13:19:40Z,"Wonderful time! Very clean and nice, the view of the ocean was amazing. Right on the beach and near clubs and bars"
933482,120794585,2017-04-05T14:22:42Z,"Nice studio, enjoyed the stay."
933482,119827552,2017-04-04T15:42:03Z,"Shane and Maru are awesome hosts, no doubt about this. I just wish their apartment was in a completely different area, and different building. The apartment was super clean and as pictured, however, the bathroom can use some major updating. The shower head is super low, my fiancé couldn't wash his hair. And the pressure quality is so weak. The shower head itself looked old, and the towel rods and shelves were aluminum and were rusty and old. The shower floor looked old too, gave me eebie jeebies showering barefoot. There wasn't dirt on the floor but it just looked old. This was unfortunate because the rest of the apartment looked like something out of a magazine, but the bathroom just didn't match up. The garbage can should be replaced because we had to open the lid with our hands, when it had a step to open it. The view is spectacular. 

Now...... We didn't make any use of the pool or beach. The beach has a bunker where we needed to literally climb down it to get into the water. The pool was super packed with people with old chairs and seating, so we didn't even bother. I was under the impression that this was a building where people actually lived, and they were just renting out their apartment. I was wrong. It doesn't look like a hotel, but it's not private apartments either. It's pretty much a hotel in an old apartment building. It's inexpensive considering the price in  south beach but I don't think it's worth it when you can't really enjoy the amenities because of how overly packed it is. Parking is free which is great, but you have to wait for about 20-25 minutes for your car, between the hours of 9am-12pm, and at night too. The crowd of people staying here were just loud, rude and obnoxious, tons of young kids. The walls are paper thin, so we heard everything from the next door. And it's right next to the elevator, so you hear noise all hours of the night. Our stay was okay. Again, awesome hosts. Super responsive and sweet people. I just wish they had another place somewhere else."
933482,44543203,2017-03-30T12:11:36Z,The place is even more beautiful in person. The location is prime. The view is wonderful. The hosts are attentive. I only have good things to say about our stay. Will definitely go back as often as we can. 
933482,79189625,2017-03-27T12:41:58Z,"Great experience! The room is super clean, fully equipped with everything we need. The building is very closed to the beach. Definitely the first choice in Miami Beach. "
933482,22576357,2017-03-12T13:36:00Z,The room has the best view! Waking up to the sunrise on the sea was beautiful. If I come back to Miami Beach I'll definitely stay there again!
933482,53939914,2017-03-11T13:11:49Z,"Overall location is great, especially with the new addition of the free Miami Beach trolley for transportation. Everything is exactly as pictured, would definitely stay again."
933482,99427987,2017-03-05T13:24:39Z,View is spectacular 
933482,10769815,2017-02-16T14:37:03Z,"Shane and Maru's apt was very clean, and as advertised. I really can't say enough about the view! They also provide you with beach towels, chairs, and an umbrella so from day one you are ready to go. 
My girlfriend and I had our schedule change our last day, and Maru was very accommodating and quick to get back to us letting us rent another night. Would definitely stay again!"
933482,77525832,2017-02-12T18:06:06Z,Shane and Maru were a great host. The apartment was beautifully furnished and had everything we needed for our stay. We loved the view of beach and enjoyed our stay! Highly recommended!
933482,7003151,2017-02-09T15:52:02Z,"I contacted Shane and Maru about the rental for a trip to Miami Beach for my 6 year old and I. They responded swoftly and positively! Our main needs were to be able to walk directly onto the beach, have a pool for use, and have an apartment with most of our basic needs including a microwave and a fridge and a sitting area. When I say that this apartment was more than perfect for us, I really mean it!
 It was clean, bright, airy, beautiful (any IKEA fans, this is your heaven!), and spacious enough for us! The view though is the ABSOLUTE best part! Being steps from the beach allowed us to come and go with ease and the fridge allowed us to stock items so that we could eat a quick breakfast and pack lunches/snacks to stay out all day if we wanted. Shane and Maru leave you with a bounty of instructions and suggestions for food, transportation, etc and were always just a text away, with quick response for needs--although we didn't need anything given that we had everything we needed! 
Beach chairs, umbrella, towels, and even a few sand toys were such a nice touch! It is clear that they are the best at hosting!
As for the grounds, it is clear that the building is undergoing some renovations, as is the building next door, and the beach area to the right of the building was under cinstruction each day, but none of that had any negative impact on our stay. 
 A 1 minute walk to witness  the glorious sunrise each morning is enough to wipe any of those minor things away. There was always adequate space for us to set up at the beachside or pool. There was no vying for spots and everyone out there was friendly.
As far as the area, although there is not much in walking distance (at least not 6 year old walking distance) it was only a few minutes Lyft ride away from everything we needed ---and Lyft average wait time was only 3 min. 
Finally, on our date of departure,  I found out that our flight was delayed. Shane and maru went out of their way to give us a later check out time to be sure that we were accommodated. I will forever be grateful for that!
In summary: excellent apartment because of location, VIEW, design, cleanliness, and hosts. I hope to be back!  And my little boy will never forget our magical time here."
933482,89405822,2017-02-05T16:16:17Z,Best host !
933482,64346841,2017-02-02T13:32:23Z,"The room was clean, right on the beach and the view is amazing. We stayed just for one night during our trip, but for that, I can say everything was good and the communication with Shane and Maru was flawless.
Only the shower head was too low from its height."
933482,20764572,2017-01-31T16:35:09Z,Spectacular view and immaculately clean.
933482,109720473,2017-01-28T14:31:58Z,"The space is a exquisitely clean and well looked after, and right on the beach. Construction on the beach made the water cloudy (but that may be finished), and construction next to the pool was a bit noisy. Had great Cuban sandwiches at Vecinos across the street. Shane and Maru are really great - very communicative and helpful."
4176197,287733,2017-05-05T12:57:12Z,"Chiara's place was the perfect home for a Florentine adventure! Location is excellent—steps from everything, yet not overrun with tourists like much of the city. And then there's the place itself, which is as adorable as the photos suggest. My girlfriend and I had a hard time pulling ourselves away from hanging out in the tranquil backyard, which we found to be as idyllic a spot as any during our time in this beautiful city. Chiara tops it all off, making the process as smooth and easy as possible! I'd stay here on all return trips, and highly recommend it to fellow travelers. "
4176197,26984822,2017-05-03T07:22:22Z,"We stayed at Chiara's apartment for 2 days and we had a very nice stay! Chiara's home is very welcoming and cosy. Everything was made for us to have a very pleasant stay in Florence, we strongly recommend this place! Thank you very much Chiara, we would be very pleased to come back again! "
4176197,98684180,2017-05-01T08:15:47Z,Lovely and well appointed apartment. It was clean and communication between my wife and I and Chiara was excellent. Quiet location but yet close to many attractions. Would definitely stay there again.
4176197,46317511,2017-04-26T08:31:32Z,"Chiara was a great host. She communicated with us before arrival making it easy to plan ahead and find the place from the train, book the best tours, reservations to eat etc.
Her place was very clean and the garden was a welcomed spot for an afternoon drink after long days of exploring. Very central to everything. We never took any transit just our feet! Highly recommend. "
4176197,32403813,2017-04-23T09:16:04Z,"Great apartment. Highly recommended! Clean, well-decorated, great location between train station and downtown. And quite a few restaurants available nearby. And Chiara is very nice and helpful. She gave us warm welcome and useful suggestions when check-in. "
4176197,21895139,2017-04-21T09:05:05Z,"Beautiful apartment! Chiara was welcoming and warm with plenty of suggestions for our stay. We enjoyed the location, especially its proximity to the train station. Highly recommend!"
4176197,47007181,2017-04-19T07:54:16Z,Loved this quaint apartment in Florence! Small but very clean with all the essentials. Very close to the central market. Chiara was very helpful and gave us many suggestions on restaurants and places to see during our stay. We enjoyed our short stay and will definitely be back.
4176197,110701598,2017-04-16T08:23:46Z,"Chiara's apartment was awesome! Great location, close to everything, beautiful private courtyard. What made it even better was Chiara herself. She was nice enough to give us a map of Florence with restaurant and gelato recommendations, both of which were excellent! Thanks for the wonderful stay!!! "
4176197,11232207,2017-04-13T06:49:58Z,"Wonderful apartment in great location. Communication was excellent. Chiara provided us with travel info and had maps and guides available.  The courtyard is lovely and there is a washing machine.  Great place, amazing host. "

4176197,118847180,2017-04-02T09:53:17Z,Chiara is an awesome host who is very welcoming to her home and happy to help with anything you may need whether it's before you arrive or during your stay. Her place is as beautiful as the pictures shown as well as her private outdoor backyard living space. So peaceful and relaxing. The location is walking distance to major places of interest as well as restaurants. Will definitely stay here again when I'm the area! 
4176197,41639691,2017-03-31T06:32:33Z,The house is lovely and suitable for vacation and useful information was provided on site. Great expernience
4176197,69438299,2017-03-30T00:43:39Z,"Great apartment in a wonderful location in Florence!  Also, Chiara was so helpful before we came in regard to advising and assisting us with tour reservations and restaurant recommendations?  All this made for an exceptional week in Florence!!"
4176197,25840491,2017-03-20T10:37:07Z,"Great apartment in a central but quiet location , lots of restaurants and shops near, easy to walk to main sites & the station. Very nice apartment- true to the photos, my adult son slept on the sofa bed which he said was comfortable. Lovely private garden. Chiara was helpful with transport advice and check-in & out was very simple and easy , she even provided guide books. I would highly recommend this apartment. "
4176197,26150427,2017-03-05T08:21:00Z,Siamo stati nella casa di Chiara per la seconda volta e non possiamo che riconfermare l'esperienza positiva della prima! La casa curata e pulita e il quartiere di San Lorenzo con il caratteristico mercato centrale merita di essere vissuto!
4176197,82276888,2017-02-27T08:32:18Z,"Couldn't have thought of a better place to spend our time at while in Florence! Was a quick walk to literally everything. Was never at a loss of thing to do. Neighborhood felt safe and was was a short walk from the train. Chiara was a great, very accommodating host! Would definitely recommend to all!"
4176197,42182227,2017-02-22T10:51:25Z,"很好的位置,离火车站步行10分钟。周围有中餐馆、意式餐厅和超市,圣母百花大教堂和老桥也都在步行范围内,非常方便。apartment安静也很干净,各种生活用品齐全,五星推荐:)"
4176197,9437301,2017-02-15T10:28:28Z,Logement parfait pour découvrir Florence. Idéalement situé vous pouvez à partir de ce dernier découvrir la ville à pied. Chiara est tres attentionée et a pris le temps de tout nous expliquer. Elle répondait très rapidement à toute nos questions pour la préparation du voyage. A recommander ! 
4176197,112058486,2017-02-12T08:56:05Z,"Thanks for the nice stay:-) 
The photographs are faithful representations. "
8360647,108218842,2017-05-14T02:06:37Z,"地理位置不错,出门10分钟内就有地铁,24小时大超市,便利店。根据房东的路线图还是很容易找到的。如果下次还有机会来,相信还是会选择这家。
"
8360647,118153918,2017-05-12T01:44:48Z,"The Korin house is exactly as advertised - warm, cosy and lovely. The traditional Japanese experience we had at Korin was really unique. We would definitely stay here again if we were to visit Osaka again in the future."
8360647,52826910,2017-05-02T23:26:33Z,Mariko人超级好 回复也很及时 对我们的行程很有帮助 住宿附近有很多吃的 胡同口出去有一家Seven eleven很方便 Mariko在家里准备了很多介绍和地图 还准备了小礼物超级贴心超级好!下次来大阪的话还会选择这里
8360647,62919148,2017-04-28T23:33:35Z,"My husband, one and half year old son and myself very enjoyed to stay in this apartment. Clean, quiet place  and nice people around : )

Mariko-San has also been very helpful in providing options around the area of the house for eating. And also guides on how to use certain appliances in the house. 

We spent 4 days. In Osaka so not enough time to explore everywhere. Not much to see in the immediate area but close enough to the subway to travel around easily!

Highly recommend!  Big enough apartment for 6 ppl comfortably. 

Many Thanks again for having us Mariko-San!"
8360647,107883417,2017-04-25T01:11:18Z,"It's really a beautiful house.
Marino is very kind.
Next time we will come to the house again."
8360647,15754855,2017-04-23T03:55:35Z,"Mariko is a great host with very detailed instructions to the place and very helpful guides on the area.  We enjoyed our stay very much and Mariko certainly made the whole experience easier and more enjoyable.  The only minor negative is with only 1 stove, cooking for a family won't be a quick exercise.  The kitchen is not set up for a lot of cooking but there are plenty of utensils, cutlery, plates and bowls etc.  Overall, it was worth the stay.  "
8360647,20909791,2017-04-15T00:52:49Z,Great place. Traditional and quiet. Mariko leaves great directions for everything in the house. Everything was extremely clean. One of the most well thought out and considerate Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Location was great even if not right at city center. Subway was fairly close and Mariko gave great recommendations for nearby restaurants. Highly recommend staying here! 
8360647,66496158,2017-04-13T02:25:59Z,"非常舒适宽敞干净的日式房屋,步行距离可至天下茶屋或岸里。厨房用具调味品一应俱全。房东热心周到,还准备了小孩零食和绘本。在大阪期间,如有机会,一定要体验入住的传统日式房屋,强烈推荐!"
8360647,101803629,2017-04-12T00:42:55Z,"A traditional house closed to the metro.
Mariko is very kind and nice. She helps us a lot.
The house should be strongly recommended!"
8360647,30949588,2017-04-10T01:09:32Z,"这次关西游入住的民宿中最棒的一家,每个小细节都能看出主人的用心,下次还想多住几天。"
8360647,43682195,2017-04-06T23:16:56Z,"很棒的傳統日式民宿和照片無違和甚至高出想像,是個很棒的民宿經驗~~房東Mariko回覆速度很快,甚至在入住前一周左右還來信提醒入住,當我們找不到民宿時,甚至出現帶我們到民宿,真的非常貼心與細心,下次若有機會會想再次入住並值得大大的推薦給朋友~~"

8360647,106673955,2017-03-27T01:22:49Z,"This is the best house in my trip. I total live  3 apartment, and Mariko is very nice. She give me a different and best experience in the trip and the house is very large, the design is tranditional japanese style. We are very enjoy that."
8360647,32622396,2017-03-23T03:54:30Z,"Really feel very comfortable and clean to stay here. Although not so much space to put our 10 people luggage but we still able to arrange. And owner very responsible, helpful, snacks, gift for us. Thank you Mariko."

8360647,84239923,2017-03-11T07:10:04Z,"Mariko's Korin place is a great place to stay. Apart from decorations and furniture in traditional Japanese style, it is also equipped with modern facilities so that you can live very comfortably. Although we don't know Japanese, there are easy to understand instructions in the house. Korin place is in a lovely and quiet area and it is only a few subway stations from Namba. Finally, Mariko is a very nice host. You will definitely love it.

8360647,41505206,2017-03-04T11:11:48Z,"우선 Mariko의 친절에 감사드립니다.
이틀 숙박할 동안 비록 그녀의 얼굴을 본 건 아니지만, 그녀는 에어비엔비 어플을 통해서 바로바로 연락될 수 있었습니다.
집은 생각보다 컸고, 우리가 생각하는 것 이상의 가치를 느낄 수 있었습니다. 같은 가격이면 좁은 평수의 호텔에 묵기보다는 여기가 훨씬 넓고 편했습니다. 
간단한 스낵과 차가 준비되어 있었으며, 이불은 부드럽고 따뜻했습니다. 부엌하고 욕실에는 항시 따뜻한 물이 나와서 모든 면에서 편리했습니다.
적극 추천합니다!"
8360647,72178270,2017-03-02T06:56:25Z,오사카 남부에 위치해 있어 간사이공항에서의 접근성이 아주 뛰어남. 주택가에 있어 아주 조용하고 현지인들의 일상을 느낄 수 있는 곳임. 전철역 5분 거리로 교통 편리. 전통가옥임에도 불구하고 불편함을 최소화하여 불편함은 거의 없었음. 주인아주머니 Mariko상 무지 친절하여 일본여행 전부터 계속해서 메시지 연락을 통해 미리 많은 정보를 얻을 수 있음.
8360647,102097535,2017-02-25T02:11:19Z,"This is the first time we live in  Japanese style house, we can touch Japanese culture during we live there. I like the design, decorations, door frame sculpture and the details especially the warm table. I think the old family they live there are harmonic and happier. Thank you Mariko take care us when we arrived late, also thanks for her letter and the origami crane ( but I forgot to bring away .)
The environment near house not prosperous but nearly railway station, so it is a good connection to go others place. I will introduce the house to my friend if they go Japan in the future. "
9424630,105602688,2017-05-12T18:23:08Z,This house is amazing! We loved every bit of it and especially Taco the cat! He was supper friendly! We will definetly be recommending this spot to our friends. 
9424630,85198657,2017-05-01T20:50:13Z,This home through the pictures does not do it in justice. It is a thousand times better in real life. The detail and the homey feel you get there is unbelievable. The art and decoration literally inspired me to come home and do a renovation. A must stay if you're in Detroit. It's only a 5 minutes car ride to the middle of Downtowns Detroit. 
9424630,10988238,2017-04-29T18:28:19Z,"Accommodation was centrally located, safe, clean, and well appointed. Check in & out couldn't be easier. Zac was great!"
9424630,29742637,2017-04-24T19:17:53Z,Place was great. Minutes from everything going on downtown and has a really great home feel to it. 
9424630,10664934,2017-04-23T20:05:39Z,"Zac and Renee's place is in a great location for visiting all the sights and neighborhoods of Detroit.  Apartment is spacious, clean, super cute, and comes with a funny cat to host you during your stay.  (he doesn't live in apartment, just visits from downstairs.)  Apartment is on second floor above an office and feels very safe.  Highly recommend!"
9424630,7960950,2017-04-19T17:46:13Z,Beautiful space - light and airy. Loved the interior decorating style as well - unique and delightful. 
9424630,114266035,2017-04-13T13:10:19Z,"Beautiful home inside and out. Very spacious, clean and cozy. Zap and Renee were easy to communicate with. Our new favorite place to stay in Detroit. "
9424630,24048005,2017-04-10T14:12:01Z,"Fantastic Airbnb experience!  This is a beautiful house to call home for a few days, in a great location and easy to get anywhere in the city.  One morning, Taco the Cat was outside and we got to pet him.  Easy parking right in front.  Book Zac and Renee's place for a memorable and easygoing Detroit trip!"
9424630,7960950,2017-04-06T17:11:16Z,"Beautiful space in Detroit! As you can see from the photos, the decorating is gorgeous and the space is bright and open. Zac and Renee were responsive and very easy to communicate with. Highly recommend."
9424630,48583331,2017-04-04T13:54:59Z,The bed was wonderful and had many great sleeps there.  The location is very convenient to all the activities that we had planned for our brief stay in Detroit.  The hosts were lovely and very responsive to our questions.  
9424630,72147625,2017-03-30T12:24:09Z,It was so great. We had to go back a second time!
9424630,29453306,2017-03-29T12:08:47Z,"Beautiful, clean, light, my dream apartment! Easy to check in, since we didn't have to coordinate meetup times, with their easy lock box for keys. If you're there during the weekday, just be aware that it's a working office below and you can hear everything, as if they're in the same room as you. Kinda rough in the mornings if you're coming from a very different time zone. Other than that, I had a fantastic stay and absolutely recommend this space."
9424630,19958315,2017-03-26T13:08:50Z,We loved staying at Zac & Renee's place! The space was both beautiful and comfortable. 
9424630,72147625,2017-03-20T12:37:29Z,The hosts are amazing and the house is stunning. So worth it. 
9424630,7960683,2017-03-19T15:14:20Z,Had a really lovely stay. The house is beautiful and the space is large and bright. Was exactly what we were hoping for. The bed and pillows are also incredibly comfortable and very nice plush bath towels - which is always nice. Impeccably clean with a nice design aesthetic - and Zac and Renee's communication couldn't have been more pleasant. Would love to come back next time we are in Detroit! 
9424630,36084716,2017-03-17T14:57:04Z, Beautiful space 
9424630,38920979,2017-03-12T12:35:19Z,Very comfortable stay
9424630,115842371,2017-03-10T16:52:15Z,Photos do this location no justice. The apartment is designed very well and provides a positive space for creativity.
9424630,8179027,2017-02-26T14:51:48Z,"I'm actually hesitant to give this apartment a good review because I don't want it to be unavailable the next time I'd like to book it.  But it's just as gorgeous as the photos indicate, and in a great location, and it comes with one of the mellowest and friendliest cats ever.  It was a very hard place to leave when my trip was over. "
9424630,91789903,2017-02-24T15:31:52Z,"I had such a great time here,the space is amaizing,super creative and unique,it's probably one of the nicest airbnb's
I have stayed at.I love Detroit and I love Zac and Renee's house.I also adore taco the cutest cat in the world!

7852204,89957065,2017-04-29T03:16:32Z,"客厅很宽敞,投影很有feel,“吊着的”床很特别,最喜欢厨房——干净,利落。"
7852204,118317328,2017-04-24T06:31:50Z,"女朋友很喜欢房子,地段也好,什么事情步行就可以 挨着地铁站 很方便 很喜欢"
7852204,113812678,2017-04-21T07:34:59Z,"房子很好,屋主也很热情!有问必答。"
7852204,122501976,2017-04-06T01:02:58Z,地理位置非常棒 去哪都不远。房间布置很有格调 也很干净 喜欢 
7852204,65846916,2017-04-04T00:49:00Z,"位置非常方便,距离地铁站步行在15分钟以内,现在又有共享单车,基本上五分钟就能到达静安寺地铁站。出了弄堂就是巨鹿路,这条路上很多超棒的餐厅。最喜欢客厅的投影仪,玩了一天之后窝在沙发上看片最爽了。唯一一点就是隔音确实不太好,外面的人只要声音稍大都能听得很清楚。"
7852204,90105987,2017-03-22T02:29:03Z,非常满意。
7852204,103748596,2017-03-19T02:33:48Z,很用心的房东 房间干净整洁适合小情侣入住 晚上逛逛上海 静安寺很有感觉
7852204,1318206,2017-03-18T00:43:34Z,"Jing的這個地方的地點真的非常好。大家需要注意這房間的隔音不是很好,但jingyou 提供耳塞。房間乾淨,跟照片一樣。"
7852204,35708173,2017-03-13T00:33:42Z,Cool place with a very large screenplay. Cozy and comfortable.
7852204,117278873,2017-03-08T02:49:55Z,"没有图片里想象的大,但是跟图片和描述的一样。房间的大小,静安嘉里中心的位置,这样的价格 我是很满意的。但是有几点是要大家注意的,首先是老房子隔音差,白天或晚上弄堂里有人走动说话,还是满明显的。其次,也可能是老房子的原因 洗澡水有点小。 最后,就是没有洗衣机,多住几天的话。会有不方便。"
7852204,109979635,2017-03-04T03:29:24Z,非常不错的体验
7852204,115741732,2017-02-19T03:59:10Z,还不错
7852204,64974618,2017-02-15T03:01:25Z,很棒很温馨
7852204,55248370,2017-02-14T02:37:52Z,房子很好 大屏幕看的也很舒服 情侣住不错 旁边还有千两和豚王
7852204,59401511,2017-02-02T08:49:55Z,"房子设计非常有个性,浪漫的Loft床,老房子气息,电影院设计也是亮点,房间厨房卫生间全都打理得井井有条一尘不染,除了老房子热水洗澡水有点小还有空调不足,厨房间要加几个茶包咖啡包,十足小资体验。"
7852204,38419526,2017-01-27T02:24:56Z,"首先地理位置很好,市中心,离静安寺不远,不管是从延安中路和巨鹿路都可以进去,但是从巨鹿路这个门进去更近一些。
入住的时候遇到一些小问题,好在房东很快就为我们解决了。房子和图片一模一样,非常美非常干净,空间很大很空旷。长长的沙发上,两个人可以躺在上面,用坚果投影看老电影,既浪漫又有情调。厨房也很干净,厨具设备也较齐全,朋友还亲自做了一盆大盘鸡。床很软,卫生间也很大。
唯一的小缺点就是由于房间太大,空调似乎有点打不到,我们住的两天略微感觉有点冷,小阁楼的空调开着又实在太干。
不过除了这一点,其他都很满意。绝对推荐!!

"
7852204,67001691,2017-01-02T01:05:07Z,"各方面都很不错,入住指南很详细明确,就是空调似乎有点散热不均……总体是很开心的一次入住,感谢房主Jing的慷慨分享!"
7852204,64842841,2016-12-31T02:16:00Z,a transitional apartment in a convenient location. 
7852204,108065059,2016-12-28T03:32:40Z,"位置很好,房东发了一个pdf告知位置,非常好找,很细心。房间很干净,床也很舒服。隔音不好,但是房东也准备了耳塞,很细心,对我这种可以睡死的人影响不大了,推荐入住"
7852204,3714089,2016-12-27T03:16:20Z,This apartment was just amazing. We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks so much for the nice host. 
5824955,33584534,2017-05-04T12:41:15Z,Absolutely amazing place with everything you need! Mike and Sol are great hosts! Would definitely recommend to a friend and will stay here again in the future!
5824955,40188691,2017-04-28T13:35:40Z,"It is a nice experience to live here with a nice night view. You can fond Sol and Mike's very good suggestion on restaurant, must try the recommendation top 1 and 2, I believe you will love it."
5824955,33579172,2017-04-13T09:46:03Z,The building is quite old and unfortunately we were visited by cockroaches in the kitchen. The apartment has a great view of the city. It didn't help that we didn't have running water for eight hours.
5824955,20959061,2017-04-06T08:56:24Z,"The apartment is cozy and well located. The view from the Terrance is breathtaking.
An incredible experience."
5824955,31629216,2017-03-25T06:15:49Z,"Sol and Mike are great hosts. The unit has spectacular views and the patio is fantastic. Few minor repairs would make it absolutely perfect. Truth Coffee across the street was fantastic!! That being said, everything else was a short Uber ride away. Located near a lot of stuff, but wouldn't recommend walking around outside at night - kind of a sketchy area once the sun goes down."
5824955,95702299,2017-03-21T07:13:23Z,"A great place centrally located in Cape Town. Excellent views from the top floor of a high building - the city, Table Mountain, Lions head, etc. - highly recommended.  The only thing is it may get hot on a warm sunny day, being on the top floor - but that's manageable and a good trade-off for the views. "
5824955,17766205,2017-03-14T08:29:24Z,"Lovely spacious apartment in a characterful location. Akin to Shoreditch in London - close to a fabulous coffee shop, independent bookshop and a shop selling local craft beers. We took ubers everywhere which was good value and safe. The large balcony on the 17th floor was a treat. Mike and Sol's tips helped us get the most from our few days and we particularly endorse their recommendation of restaurants the Cousins and Miller's Thumb. We add our own recommendation of the Shortmarket Club. As clearly stated in the description, the apartment is not air conditioned and this means that the second bedroom can get very warm on hot evenings. That said, we all loved the apartment and thank our hosts for a great stay.  "
5824955,101208305,2017-03-11T06:44:08Z,"Sol and Mike's place has a spectacular view over the city and we spent a lot of time on the terrace of the apartment. The apartment seems to have been used a lot for air bnb, so there are some small faults( loose taps, loose shower head, slippery bathroom floors, no aircon, so the smaller bedroom is pretty difficult to get fresh air into). Overall, we really much enjoyed our stay on the 17th floor with the breathtaking view, so the pros definitely made up for the cons!"
5824955,89299937,2017-03-05T08:30:44Z,Beautiful apartment with sweeping views.  Very close to everything.  Sol and Mike were quick to respond. 
5824955,45067527,2017-03-03T09:28:25Z,"We spent 3 nights at Sol and Mike's penthouse and it was one of the best if not the best place we stayed at during our 15 days in SA. The flat is nice, well decorated with everything you need , even the wifi which is not always the case ! The terrasse and the views on CBD are just amazing and enjoying the sunrise or sunset is just a must . Sol and Mike are nice and kind hosts always making sure you feel ok. The long list of their pretty good recommendations is quite precious. The area is one of my favorite in Cape Town and there are many things to do, see and visit at walking distance, including just walking around and enjoy the so special atmosphere of Mother City historical center "
5824955,8172100,2017-02-22T07:04:35Z,Just like the photos. Stunning views of the city and a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing. Check in/out is an easy process and Mike was great with answering any questions we had.
5824955,74443992,2017-02-19T07:04:11Z,"Truly fantastic city - if you have never been to Cape Town and  you only have  few days then this area is good to set up as a Base from which to do things as they are very ,much dependant on the weather. It so changeable from one side of the mountain to another and if the sea is too rough u cannot go to Robben "
5824955,3352885,2017-02-12T10:16:34Z,Very fine apartment with a wonderful Captown view. 
5824955,8004967,2017-02-08T06:04:22Z,Really enjoyed the stay. The apartment is spacious and modern with great views over Cape Town. The balcony area is especially cool with good views of Lions head and the city. Well located for a city stay and just across the road from one of the best coffee shops in the world. Would definitely book again.
5824955,90419285,2017-02-06T06:21:54Z,good place to be! :)
5824955,18537492,2017-01-29T07:33:14Z,Super Unterkunft sehr zentral und eine tolle Übersicht über kapstadt!Zu fuss sind viele lokale und Bars zu erreichen!Zur beliebten waterfront kann man sehr günstig mit dem Taxi fahren!
5824955,95250194,2017-01-23T08:07:34Z,"The place is ok , lots of maintenance is required. I never met the host and no effort was made from their side to assist me with cleaning arrangements. The place is also dusty. I would rather scout around next time or stay at a hotel. The place is extremely hot and uncomfortable because there are no aircons. If you leave the windows open the place gets full of bugs."
5824955,4402697,2017-01-20T05:41:51Z,The view from this spacious fully equipped apartment were fantastic.  Sitting on the balcony with coffee in the morning was amazing.  The location is perfect and the secure parking provided peace of mind.
5824955,30015570,2017-01-05T08:17:57Z,"Fabulous apartment in a great location! Mike was such a great,helpful host. We had a great stay and enjoyed the view and pool in the evening. If you stay here make sure you check out Trust coffee shop close by x "

9449724,8683178,2017-04-29T09:20:27Z,Super nice room in a fantastic apartment. Sarah is a perfect host. Highly recommended. 
9449724,58189094,2017-04-12T14:09:04Z,Great value with shops and transport to the centre readily available. Host was very helpful
9449724,119293561,2017-04-11T08:37:00Z,"Logement très bien situé à côté du métro. À proximité de bars et restaurants très sympathiques. Sarah nous a donné de très bons conseils et nous a très bien accueillis, je recommande!"
9449724,62355362,2017-04-05T10:08:15Z,"If you want to find a stylish place and near public transport,I recommend this place to you.Thank for Sarah's hosting"
9449724,64571121,2017-04-04T07:16:57Z,"Sarah's place was really clean, lovely and well-decorated. The tube station was within walking distance of the place. There's a Tesco express nearby. Sarah was really nice and helpful. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay :) "
9449724,50464349,2017-04-02T10:20:53Z,"Sarah was very kind and welcoming. She offered some amazing suggestions for places to see, things to do, and eat. I would definitely stay here again whenever I'm in london next. Her place is less than a minute or two from both the tram and bus stops which was super convenient. Also, she lives right off of a main road which is perfect for locating her place. There's a grocery store, cute local restaurants, and bars in the neighborhood. Thanks again for your hospitality Sarah!"
9449724,57874290,2017-03-27T10:58:49Z,Room in Amazing loft at quite place close to public transportation 
9449724,68493122,2017-03-26T09:12:33Z,Sarah was very friendly and helped us a lot. Place was even better than at the photos! 
9449724,89538872,2017-03-25T08:46:50Z,"Sarah war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Wohnung ist gut zu erreichen - man ist in 15 Minuten in der Stadt. 
Das Zimmer war schön und sauber. 
Wir würden die Unterkunft weiterempfehlen!"
9449724,54328253,2017-03-16T09:57:32Z,Sarah is extremely kind and helpful! I shall definitely consider booking with her again on my next trip. 
9449724,23728377,2017-03-15T11:38:35Z,Sarah's place was great. Clean room with tea and coffee facilities in the bedroom. The place seems pretty secure too. It's handy being next to the train station and major bus routes. I recommend staying here.
9449724,12675460,2017-03-13T11:47:12Z,"The area is fine. Communication with Sarah is efficient. The room is far smaller the one on the photograph. Everything is clean. Mattrass and pillow are softish, did not sleep too well. Bathroom and toilet are in one, and shared with hosts.   Low price, commensurate stay. "
9449724,105211267,2017-03-12T11:39:44Z,"Superbre première expérience air bnb! Sarah est très accueillante et communicative !  Ne pas hésitez à lui demander des renseignements sur les différents restos ou pubs du coin. 

Great first Airbnb experience! Sarah is really helpful and welcoming ! Don't hesitate to ask her for any piece of advice (especially for restaurants and pubs!)"
9449724,29095585,2017-03-10T08:50:33Z,Nous sommes restées une seule nuit chez Sarah. Nous avons été très agréablement surprise par la chambre qui est bien plus spacieuse que sur les photos. L'appartement est magnifique et très bien situé ! Rapport qualité prix parfait je conseille très fortement ! En plus de ça Sarah est au petit soin c'était vraiment super ! 
9449724,113794566,2017-03-09T09:51:21Z,"The room and shared bathroom are both very clean and a decent size, in a nice modern apartment. Definitely chic! The area is up and coming and if you like to jog then there's a great run along the nearby canal to Regents Park. There are also two really good pubs serving food and a craft beers to suit all tastes. It's just a 30 min walk to the City or the station is 1 min and a short ride in. All round, a very convenient place to stay."
9449724,7513151,2017-03-07T11:47:46Z,A good convenient place. Thanks!
9449724,20097879,2017-03-05T10:35:01Z,Sarah's place is great for your shorttrip to London! She also gives you the best leads where you can enjoy the city the most.

Man kann immer mit Sarah schreiben und sie war sogar für ein early check-in zu haben. Das war super!
Das Bad haben wir uns zu viert geteilt, daher dort ein paar Minuspunkte, auch wegen der Sauberkeit. Ansonsten völlig in Ordnung!"
9449724,63693357,2017-02-27T08:11:46Z,Sarahs Wohnung ist ein echtes Schmuckstück!
9449724,40837102,2017-02-19T08:40:41Z,Sarah nous a donné de bons conseils de visite... En anglais mais aussi en français s il vous plaît.
1237886,16260719,2017-03-04T03:38:54Z,Peter and Kelly's place is a heavenly garden retreat.  The house is beautifully appointed and homey at the same time.  Kelly and Peter are very personable and had great suggestions about what to see and where to eat off the beaten path in Nairobi.  I will definitely stay again.  
1237886,102410982,2016-12-30T05:19:43Z,"Our stay at Hob House was perfect. Every detail from the ambience, the lush gardens, the styling of the rooms and warmth of the hosts and the staff were lovingly managed to ensure we were comfortable, well fed and that we enjoyed our stay in Nairobi. Highly recommended. "
1237886,10107620,2016-12-19T05:30:07Z,"Hob house is fantastic. An oasis in a busy city perfect for a base in Nairobi. Delicious food, relaxing atmosphere and fabulous hosts who make you feel at home. Thank you Kelly and Peter for an amazing experience. We are looking forward to seeing you again soon."
1237886,1829018,2016-11-28T05:02:49Z,"The past 4 days at the Hob House was truly the best Airbnb experience I have ever had. It is hard to put down in words what a truly magical place the Hob House is. Kelly and Peter are the most welcoming, entertaining, accommodating hosts you could ever ask for. Between offering me rides, sharing meals with them and the great conversations, it was hard to leave Monday morning for my flight. They truly think of every detail and go above and beyond what you would expect out of an Airbnb stay. Though it may not be right in the city, I actually preferred it, as it was peaceful and serene. Don't even get me started on how incredible the food was. I tried every breakfast they offered and the Lebanese one was my favourite, by far. I also ate dinner every night there, because I was so impressed with the cooking. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Hob House and cannot wait to go back! I could write all day about the amazing things about this place, but I think you get the idea."
1237886,31533156,2016-10-19T06:24:19Z,"We stayed for 4 nights as a couple. Hob House is the most wonderfully warm, cosy, peaceful and homely place you could wish to stay in. Peter, Kelly, Lydia, Angeline, Salome, David, and all the staff were incredibly generous, thoughtful, and welcoming. It is a gorgeous home to be in, from the amazing collection of books and beautiful furniture, to the hand made table serviette holders. The house is so calm and quiet -you'll be woken by birds singing and roosters crowing - but is accessible by car to the main Nairobi attractions. We took day trips to the National Park, giraffe sanctuary, elephant orphanage, museums, Karura Forest, and Lake Naivasha, and it was a pleasure to come home each evening, kick our boots off, and relax in our room.

We loved sitting with the other guests at breakfast and dinner too, chatting & swapping stories. Infact we ended up eating at the house every night because the food that Salome prepared was so hearty and delicious. She took such care to prepare vegan meals for us and nothing was too much trouble.  She even sang when she  was cooking:) All the staff infact showed such genuine kindness and hospitality. We arrived with a smile and a positive feeling, and we got it it back tenfold. We felt so looked after during our time at Hob House and were sorry we only stayed 4 nights. If you're visiting Nairobi, Hob House is definitely recommended!"
1237886,41345969,2016-09-14T07:34:22Z,"Staying at the Hob House was an experience like no other. It does actually feel like staying with family or close friends, courtesy the warmth that Kelly brings to the place. The house itself is beautiful, immaculately decorated, with great taste and verve, and is comfortable and convenient. The staff is efficient and helpful. Salome is a great cook and very helfpful with anything that you may want. I got clothes ironed, the guy at the gate packed the Masai I had bought for me. Taxi services offered by Humpryies are reliable and reasonably priced. The beds are comfortable, food is delicious, the location albeit a little outside is not tol far away and Westlands is a 10 minute or so drive. I would not be staying anywhere else in Nairobi in the future. Give it a try; you wont regret it a single bit. "
1237886,2759174,2016-09-01T06:11:47Z,"Peter and Kelly (his wife) were really great and welcoming. They made sure to answer all of our questions, and were very accessible on the phone, via email before the trip, and on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). The chefs cooked some amazing breakfasts for us - we were really happy with the food, especially the Lebanese breakfast! The house is beautiful with a really nice garden/backyard, and exactly as specified in the listing. Hot water was an issue on our first two nights, but this was fixed for our third when we informed Peter. The house is located in a safe area, but is a little difficult/ confusing to find on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps or relay to taxi drivers as it isn't near a well-known landmark and is in a suburb that is a bit of a distance away from the city center. The area is also not very well-lit at night. We found it tough to explore the nightlife in the city as a result, but it was also nice to hang out as a group (since we were 6) in the house since it was large enough and had comfortable and cozy furniture / a fireplace."
1237886,2684734,2016-06-16T09:01:56Z,The Hob House felt very safe and was a beautiful oasis slightly outside of the main hub of Nairobi.  The rooms were clean and tastefully decorated and the backyard space was a very calming and relaxing place to hang out (and watch birds at the feeders).  Expect to mingle with other guests in the common spaces and during meals.
1237886,10689799,2016-06-13T02:43:31Z,"I've travelled a fair amount & stayed in a few airbnbs but I think this was my best experience!! Hob house felt like a home away from home. The house is beautifully decorated with plenty of space to unwind. This was my first visit to Nairobi but I felt very safe at Hob House. Jelly & Peter made us feel like a part of their family, cooking is wonderful Lebanese food. All the staff are incredibly helpful & polite. Highly recommend staying at Hob house. "
1237886,32745643,2016-06-09T10:24:12Z,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1237886,60539266,2016-04-01T12:42:49Z,"Prachtige B&B die erg rustig gelegen is, net buiten het drukke stadscentrum. We verbleven hier maar voor 1 nacht, maar voelden ons meteen thuis. De ontvangst van Kelly was zeer hartelijk! Gezelligheid troef samen met de andere gasten en een overheerlijk diner. Onze complimenten aan de chef! Ondanks dat we niet allemaal even goed Engels spraken, vormde dit absoluut geen struikelblok en voelde iedereen zich op zijn gemak en thuis. Kelly en Peter staan steeds voor je paraat en zijn erg begaan met hun gasten. Transfer naar de luchthaven was prima geregeld. Dankjewel voor alles! Mochten we ooit nog eens in Nairobi zijn, komen we zéker en vast terug langs!"
1237886,12940330,2015-09-22T15:30:34Z,"Home away from home! Peter and Kelly are the wonderful hosts of this beautiful, quaint and cosy B&B in a safe and quiet area of Nairobi. Their help and feedback was unfailing as was their assistance in everything we needed. Amazing breakfast too: delicious French Toast and cinnamon oatmeal (Salome's own secret recipe). Once the road to the house from Peponi Rd. is tarmacked it will be hard to keep guests away. Highly recommended. "
1237886,1900434,2015-08-30T16:59:41Z,"Hands down, up there with the best accommodation experiences I've ever had. Peter and Kelly were fabulous hosts and were so amazingly helpful throughout our stay -- before, during, and after. Their home was truly stunning. Honestly one of the warmest, most beautiful places I've ever had the fortune of setting foot in. I can't recommend this place enough if you're looking to stay in Nairobi!"
1237886,8023559,2015-08-01T15:10:09Z,"I booked a two night stay for my daughters and their two boyfriends at Hob House. They found everything about the place to be perfect. They enjoyed a lovely breakfast and two evening meals, everyone was so kind no friendly. Peter reassured me of their safe arrival when I hadn't heard from them after their long flights to Nairobi. They had a great day out around Nairobi driven by a driver recommended by the hosts. Thank you Kelly and Peter for taking good care of them! "
1237886,4838037,2015-07-26T15:59:30Z,"Peter was the best! He was incredibly helpful and communicative throughout the entire booking process. Even offered an airport transfer to make things easier. Next time we are in Nairobi, we will definitely stay with him :)"
1237886,22296461,2015-03-23T13:53:01Z,"The Hob House was an amazing experience. Peter and his staff were extremely welcoming. They were helpful in every way. Everything from the room to the morning breakfast, was a delight. If we visit Kenya again, we would certainly stay in the Hob House again.  Thanks Peter for everything! Tell everyone we said hello and we miss them. "
1237886,21230157,2015-03-14T13:07:38Z,"Peter is easily one of the best hosts that I've ever encountered on airbnb. His home was incredibly well kept and his staff was very warm and welcoming. Peter went out of his way to ensure that we had proper directions, even after we arrived very late in the evening. He was alos available to answer questions and provide recommendations throughout our stay. The actual house was fantastic. There is plenty of room in each bedroom and the amenities are some of the best that I have seen in my travels. In addition to a great welcome and a very clean and well-decorated home, the Hob House also provides the option of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We enjoyed a very flavorful breakfast each morning consisting of fresh eggs, bacon, sausage, and local fruits (the best mango you’ll ever have). We also enjoyed a wonderful dinner of chicken, rice, and salad—all crafted with local and fresh ingredients. All said, my group of six travelers together agreed that we would definitely stay at the Hob House again. Highly recommend!"
1237886,14152065,2015-02-22T15:49:53Z,"Peter & Kelly are the epitome of hospitable hosts! Lovely house, warm staff, super clean & delicious food. They really know how to make you feel at home! Hob house is in a quite residential neighborhood, making it perfect for relaxing but not too far from the tourist attractions. The staff, Ruth & Salome, are so friendly and accommodating. Wish I could have stayed longer!  "
1237886,2618620,2015-01-30T12:27:07Z,"Peter and Kelly were incredibly welcoming and wonderful hosts. Ruth, Jane and Lucy made wonderful breakfasts, and helped ensure we were well looked after.

Hob house is beautiful and was very comfortable. They've apparently recently moved, and the last stretch to the house is on an unfinished, bumpy road, but that added to the charm. The Kitisuru suburb is a bit removed from Nairobi, but at the same time, seems very safe and has lots of expat amenities.

Would definitely stay there again!"
1237886,25158718,2015-01-11T13:47:10Z,"Please note as you read my review that I was only in town for one night/day. 

Peter has moved to a new house in/around Westlands, the house is equally as beautiful as the original pictures shown. Peter set up airport pickup (for our 6am flight) and greeted us (me and three friends) upon arrival at the house. We were trying to make the most of our one day in Nairobi so Peter prearranged an 11AM Safari in Nairobi National Park with a local tour company. Upon arrival we napped and were greeted with a full breakfast complete with homemade rhubarb tarts. The staff on hand were extremely accommodating (for minimal charges) and left nothing to chance. The rooms all offered en suite bathrooms and all the amenities necessary to feel at home. The house has plenty of space to set up a meal inside or outside for those who want to enjoy the beautiful Nairobi weather. 

The house is located off of two unpaved roads with no street lights so at night you will need to secure a driver that knows the area as it can be a bit difficult to get in and out without someone who knows the area. Peter has drivers that he uses so that will not likely be a problem for most visitors.

Both Peter and his wife are well traveled and  engaging, both spent time with our group when we were in the house, this aspect made you feel like you were visiting old friends as opposed to a hotel/B&B feel. At no point were they intrusive or overbearing, simply interested in getting to know us better and sharing their own experiences.

I would recommend this location to any friends visiting Nairobi."
645850,54765706,2017-04-14T08:46:18Z,"Nuestra estancia en las cabañas fue fantástica de principio a fin. La hospitalidad impecable, muy buen recibimiento y comunicación, un ambiente distendido y agradable, y unas instalaciones que combinan a la perfección la conexión con la naturaleza y un toque rústico con la comodidad. Está cuidado hasta el último detalle y todo tiene un toque encantador. Intentaremos convertirlo en tradición, porque ha sido una auténtica gozada. La cabaña preciosa, levantarte viendo la sierra con la luz del sol y el canto de los pájaros es algo incomparable. "
645850,116858632,2017-04-11T09:38:26Z,"Dormir conectados con la naturaleza, escuchar los sonidos de los insectos, los pájaros, la madera crujir... el caminar con los pasitos de las patitas de Igor siguiéndome... los deliciosos huevos de las gallinas felices..."
645850,119662808,2017-04-06T06:06:59Z,Had the most amazing time in this beautifully magical place! Where I could really clean my mind ! Already planing my next visit 
645850,115656668,2017-03-19T10:47:59Z,"Bueno, pero que vamos a poner... ya pusimos todas nuestras palabras en el libro de la habitación. Ah!!! quizás... una cosa: los sapos del charco, o los ojos juguetones de Igor, o el respirar debajo de la ducha, o el olor a café en nuestra caravana ""digo nuestra, porque casi nos la traemos"" me sé cada tornillo que tiene clavado, (por cierto, Silvain y Rosa, espectacular trabajo, seguro que el vivero os queda genial también) y el despertar, si, se me olvidaba ese momento, el abrir los ojos y mirar entre las ramas de los árboles la nieve tallada sobre las montañas, y el viento en la noche pidiendo permiso para entrar en nuestra casita, y los ecos en nuestros oídos pidiendo que aquello no se acabase, y.... y .... si, ya, todo es más de una cosa, pero es que tenemos mil momentos!!!!

Gracias, por dejarnos entrar en vuestra casa."
645850,37009829,2017-03-11T09:19:49Z,"This place is absolutely magical. The accommodation is comfortable and thoughtfully built and decorated. The hikes in the surrounding area are beautiful. Rosa and Sylvain are perfect hosts, very accommodating and friendly. My few days escape here completely exceeded my expectations. I left feeling peaceful, energised and inspired. "
645850,114635781,2017-03-05T09:38:59Z,Un entorno fantástico para sentir y apreciar la naturaleza con un encanto único. Rosa y Sylvain los dueños son gente muy agradable y simpático que están haciendo un paraíso compatible con la naturaleza. 
645850,108582488,2017-02-05T10:50:26Z,"Simplemente, fenomenal"
645850,104268666,2016-12-17T10:42:25Z,"Rosa en Sylvain zijn zeer warme en open mensen. Ze hebben een prachtige plek gemaakt (en zijn daar nog volop mee bezig), die hun creativiteit volledig reflecteert; in muurschilderingen, in het plateau in een boom; de nieuwe zelfgemaakte 'pipowagen' die als 'hangplaats en binnenkeuken gaat fungeren - alles is even kleurrijk en met liefde gemaakt. Vanaf aankomst tot vertrek heb ik mij welkom gevoeld. Te allen tijde kon ik bij ze terecht, en dachten zij direct mee bij vragen; tegelijkertijd voelde ik mij volkomen vrij om mijn eigen gang te gaan.
De keuken, die nu nog buiten is, is goed voorzien van kookmateriaal en koelkast. Door de grote straalkachel was koken ondanks de onverwachte koude en sneeuw prima te doen. Zeker als Rosa mij af en toe uitnodigde om met hen koffie te drinken in hun prachtige huis.
Een hartverwarmende ervaring."
645850,29557851,2016-12-13T07:08:21Z,Great experience!
645850,105129108,2016-12-11T10:00:40Z,"Rosa y Sylvain son unas personas geniales, con un corazón aún más grande que las montañas tan maravillosas que se pueden ver desde sus cabañas! Una experiencia que nos hizo recordar nuestra infancia, la casita en el árbol muy, pero muy bonita y original. "
645850,102126493,2016-12-05T10:36:57Z,Experiencia increíble con gente increíble 
645850,49235139,2016-11-27T10:47:01Z,"La estancia genial, incluso con lluvia como nos pillo fueron unos dias mágicos! Mil gracias a Rosa y Silvain, con cariño Marc y Raquel!"
645850,12998507,2016-11-16T09:26:41Z,"Una experiencia maravillosa !!! 
Un lugar con mucho encanto , un lugar para soñar y desconectar de todo . 
Sois encantadores!! Y Urko para comérselo "
645850,19530274,2016-11-01T07:31:30Z,"Nuestra experiencia en CampeArte ha sido fantástica. El lugar es ideal para desconectar y estar en contacto con la naturaleza.
Rosa y Sylvain son unos anfitriones maravillosos y están ahí en todo momento para lo que necesites.
Nos dejaron quedarnos en la cabaña grande más de la cuenta para que estuviéramos más agustito (lo cual agradecimos mucho porque era un espacio adorable.
Es un lugar precioso y ellos lo hacen mejor todavía, repetiremos de nuevo sin duda y lo recomiendo 100%."
645850,70440606,2016-10-30T08:48:51Z,"Fue todo perfecto, mejor de lo esperado. Nos ayudaron con las indicaciones para llegar, nos enseñaron y explicaron como estaba todo hecho e hicieron que nos sintiesemos como en casa. El lugar expectacular para desconectar y disfrutar de la naturaleza. Todo muy limpio y cuidado cada detalle. La casita en el arbol muy acogedora, aunque hiciese un poco de frio fuera dentro de la casita se estaba bien, y el lugar en general superbonito. Repetiremos seguro."
645850,57022123,2016-10-23T09:54:32Z,"Experiencia única! 100% recomendable para personas que les guste la naturaleza, la paz....  Los anfitriones amables y hospitalarios! Muchas gracias"
645850,87884613,2016-10-11T08:33:23Z,"Wow! What an experience. I urge anyone looking for a relaxing and eye opening travel destination to book here, no doubt. Rosa and Sylvain are both very intelligent, humble and interesting people, that go out of their way to make sure you are happy. Rosa spent the day with me, teaching me to make homemade marmalade and picking fruit, and also let me come see the beach with them, which was a lovely personal touch to the holiday. If you are a female solo traveller, or any traveller in that matter, and need a safe place to go, this is it. Thank you both for making my experience so beautiful, the views were incredible. An idyllic place for clearing the mind and being truly happy. The treehouse's are amazing. Thank you for inspiring me. X"
645850,94539415,2016-09-17T09:24:58Z,"Rosa y Sylvain estupendos anfitriones, amables en todo momento. El sitio estupendo muy cuidado, con unas vistas maravillosas. La cabaña de cuento, muy bonita y preparada a todo detalle. La experiencia muy positiva. Repetiré seguro. Urko el perro un tesoro. "
645850,28384497,2016-08-26T11:07:54Z,"Estuve en una de las cabañas con mi hijo, cuando la reserve pensé que sería una bonita experiencia para él que tiene 10 años, pero nuestra estancia ha sobrepasado nuestras expectativas, han sido 4 días inolvidables para los dos.
Rosa y Sylvain son unos anfitriones estupendos, nos hemos sentido como en casa y como si nos conociéramos de toda la vida. Vivir en el árbol por tres días ha sido maravilloso. Hemos disfrutado también la piscina, y unos vecinos con los que hemos hecho una amistad inesperada.
No hay lujos, tampoco los necesito ni los quiero, hay todo lo necesario y todo esta limpio, y si necesitas algo, los anfitriones están a tu disposición para facilitartelo. Eso sí, si lo que quieres es tener todo lo que tendrías en la ciudad pero en el (URL HIDDEN) vayas, no es esa la idea. Pero si lo que quieres es desconectar de todo, estar unos días en medio de la sierra y (URL HIDDEN) lo dudes."
645850,44278372,2016-08-22T09:35:24Z,"Rosa and Sylvain are very Kind and helpful with everything, both the place and the sorroundings are amazing! The perfect weekend trip!"
2375804,119539527,2017-05-07T13:44:18Z,"Great location, couldn't be closer to the beach as well as good food options "
2375804,74499591,2017-04-24T12:42:53Z,"Es war ein schöner Aufenthalt hier. Von der Ausstattung war es gut, von dem Ambiente sind die Möbel teilweise schon etwas abgewohnt. Der Spiegelschrank im Bad ist teilweise verrostet und mit Pflegeutensilien befüllt, wie Cremes oder Zahnpasta, was wir nicht so angenehm fanden und diesen daher nicht benutzt haben. Klasse waren die Stühle, die man mit an den Strand nehmen kann. Insgesamt hat es uns gefallen aber am Mobiliar müsste mal verbessert werden."
2375804,108541253,2017-04-18T13:28:19Z,Estadia maravilhosa. Tudo conforme prometido.
2375804,56763363,2017-04-15T18:19:08Z,"Charming one room studio on Miami Beach.     We hopped on bikes you rent on the street (Citibike) and had a nice ride down to South Beach.  

This area of Miami Beach is less crowded and has more residents.  Great place.  The host is terrific. Very responsive.  

It's a small, simple room on the second floor of a historic building on the beach.  "
2375804,44619523,2017-04-12T18:07:27Z,Great host. Check in was easy and simple. Location is the best it's less than 20 steps from the beach 
2375804,80068704,2017-04-10T12:45:36Z,Highly recommended.

2375804,115386627,2017-04-02T15:18:46Z,"Der Aufenthalt im Charming Studio war super !
Christian war ein toller Gastgeber , der auf alle Fragen schnell antwortete. Check-In lief auch reibungslos aufgrund einer Lock-Box. 
Die Lage war toll, da der Strand nur eine Minute entfernt war und dieser auch sehr familienfreundlich und sauber war !
Viele Parkmöglichkeiten, die nicht teuer sind und 2 Blöcke weiter umsonst. 
Gerne wieder ! Vielen Dank Christian !"
2375804,67487447,2017-03-27T12:18:35Z,Perfect spot
2375804,34073800,2017-03-22T13:31:19Z,Outstanding view across a quiet road from the beach. North beach´s best kept secret. Would stay again.
2375804,49577928,2017-03-20T12:19:54Z,Right by the beach and easy walking distance to stores.
2375804,75980373,2017-02-20T02:03:27Z,"The location off this Beach Condo is amazing, metres from the beach, food, shops cafes.  Our host Christian is a very friendly helpful host.  Having booked this from Australia and not knowing the layout off Miami, we found it a hassle to get public transport, we had to rely on cabs to places we had booked.  Whilst you can see the ocean from the side window, we missed having a place to sit for morning coffee and afternoon drinks, there is now where to just sit and relax and enjoy the view.  we managed to open one window one night but the noise from the resultant below made us close it. This is an ideal location if you just want a place to shower and sleep, our kind off holiday is to sit back a smell the coffee , the kitchen is well equipped to make your own food, but unless you want to sit at the little table inside, there wasn't a common area you could spend time."
2375804,26356436,2017-02-13T15:22:11Z,"Nice place! Exactly as described- quiet and clean, a one minute walk to the beach. Well-stocked with necessities, comfortable bed. Very easy check-in process. Thank you :)"
2375804,63540814,2017-02-12T18:34:44Z,Place was great. Steps to the beach and lots of places to eat including a breakfast place right under you! Would definitely recommend 
2375804,49869845,2017-02-09T14:24:33Z,"Christian is a fabulous host! The place is exactly as shown, very nice little charming studio steps away from the beach. It was exactly what we were looking for. South Beach is only 7 miles away by car. There are a lot of local yummy restaurants in the area within walking distance. Christian had everything in the studio right down to the beach chairs and beach towels!! All you have to do is bring you bathing suits, snacks and drinks!! The bed and pillows very comfy too! Christian was a great communicator as well, always got right back to us! We will defiantly be back and stay at his place!!  Thank you Christian we had a very nice time!! "
2375804,99416613,2017-02-05T14:34:32Z,"Great view, the beach is at your front door. Eclectic neighborhood with excellent nearby restaurants."
2375804,59120913,2017-02-03T13:12:09Z,"The location is perfect for being able to visit the beach, take a stroll at any time of the day or night, eat at a variety of restaurants, and play Pokemon Go!

I found the room perfect for my needs. The building was quiet at night, even though the Bandshell is just across the street.

The free trolley is just a block away.  Everything is so convenient!  Walgreens is nearby too.

The studio has everything you could possibly need, even instant coffee and shampoo!

Great set-up for out-of-town guests.  I will return with my husband!"
2375804,89829901,2017-01-30T03:20:45Z,"Place was great, it was exactly what the description says.  Only recommendation would be to get thicker curtains to help keep more light out at night. It was not too bad but would help. Christian made it easy to get in and check out. Distance to beach could not be beat."
2375804,28461296,2017-01-27T14:26:14Z,"Christian's place is great, It is right by the beach! Shops and a variety of good restaurants are closeby. There happened to be a food truck event going on during our stay and that was awesome. I definitely recommend staying here"
2375804,90292897,2017-01-23T13:53:40Z,"Great little place if you're looking to hang out at the beach. Christian had everything I needed - beach chairs, towels, even sunscreen and a bag to carry stuff out to the ocean."
8447844,38888415,2017-05-12T01:57:52Z,"Yui is super friendly and response to our queries extremely promptly. The place is minutes to Shinosaka station and metro station. Room is perfect for 3-4 people and have all necessary amenities one could ever wants. Yui also left us with yummy food for our stay. The accommodation is very clean and airy. All in all, highly recommend for everyone who is coming to Osaka!"

8447844,40225199,2017-05-01T02:54:24Z,"A great home away from home. Yui's check in process was extremely easy  and finding her place was a breeze with the information provided after booking.

The house itself was very clean when we arrived and all amenities were provided along with a few extra snacks from Yui! 

There are many local restaurants and convinience stores in the area. Some even within a minute from the apartment and Shin-Osaka (a major transportation hub) around 5 minutes away! 

Yui was always readily available to help us if we had any questions regarding anything in and around the apartment 

I would highly recommend Yui's place to anyone wanting to stay in the Osaka area. Transportation, restaurants and a quiet neighbourhood make for an amazing stay.

작은 아파트형식이었는데 일본집은 정말 공간 활용을 잘 되어있는 것 같아요. 오밀조밀 생활에 필요한 모든것이 아파트안에 있습니다. 치약 칫솔정도만 준비해 가면 될 것 같아요. 세탁기로 빨래도 한번 했어요. yui의 친절하고 빠른 답변도 정말 감사했습니다. "
8447844,66393137,2017-04-22T01:09:10Z,"本次是和3个好朋,一共四人一起入住。特别棒的地方,很干净,房东超级好,做了从新大阪站到房间的视频,很容易就找到了。

房间内一应俱全,非常感谢!
我的朋友都很开心!"
8447844,108806063,2017-04-19T23:07:01Z,"We stayed with six adults and an infant.  A little tight, but very comfortable.  Our stay was great.  Conveniently located to the Shin-Osaka station, I enjoyed our short little walks before our excursion each day.  Very accurate and clear directions to the home were provided, which allowed this first time traveller to Japan to arrive without issue.  Would definitely consider staying again."
8447844,44161834,2017-04-15T23:48:27Z,"The location is great. Near JR Shin-Osaka Station and railway line (Midōsuji Line) Nishinakajima-Minamigata Station, which save a lot of our time travelling around Osaka.
The place is clean and spacious. One must be careful with the low ceiling dining hall light to avoid hitting your head."
8447844,92890472,2017-04-13T01:16:53Z,Even though it was a one night stay Yui made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Plenty of space and gave us a warm welcome with some Japanese treats. We couldn't ask for anything more. Overall a great one day experience. 
8447844,94222658,2017-04-11T02:07:54Z,"Great location and lovely, clean flat."

8447844,15699528,2017-04-02T02:15:13Z,"If I could rate this place more than 5 stars, I definitely would. Yui-san is a very gracious host, she is attentive, thoughtful & very responsive. The place looks even better than the photos, on the bigger size compared to JP standards, very clean & bright. Everything works perfectly well & the location is perfect to travel between Kyoto & Osaka for sightseeing, with direct access to Kansai airport by Haruka train. If you have JR rail pass you can take shinkansen to Kyoto in less than 15 minutes. The apartment is in a quiet location yet very close to main train station. I had my own pocket wifi so the usage limit didn't bother me, even though the mattress is a bit too soft for my liking. Overall we had such a perfect 4-night stay and will not hesitate to recommend to everyone (best suit families of 4)!"
8447844,83184044,2017-03-29T02:53:05Z,"Yui的房子很大很干净,离新大阪站很近,所以去周边城市也都很方便。比起酒店性价比高,非常推荐。"

8447844,99348004,2017-03-22T02:00:10Z,"Less than 10min walk from Shin-Osaka station. Apartment is nicely done up, clean and cosy. There is a lift, therefore no need to drag the luggages up the stairs. There are 4 of us and the space is just nice. Yui is a great host. Always prompt in her reply and willing to assist. "
8447844,22526601,2017-03-17T02:21:29Z,The apartment is clean and well located. Yui is very helpful and efficient. Perfect short stay. Thank you

チェックインの時、お菓子でもいただき、本当に嬉しかったです~

8447844,10699108,2017-03-12T01:06:45Z,"Yui is an excellent host who personally settled our need for an extra bed after we checked in. It was definitely much appreciated and added to our comfort -- we were 4 adults. The apartment is centrally located near many train stations, restaurants and convenience stores. Yui responds quickly to communication -- from beginning to end. A real pro!"

7237079,28212080,2017-04-25T02:27:12Z,"This is probably one of the most beautiful properties that I've ever come across to in Airbnb, perfectly set in the charming residential neighborhood of Setagaya. Charming, bright, and comfortable. I would recommend anyone to stay at Hidenori's property with his lovely family (his daughter, Sora, is just the cutest). Hope you can find the chance to stay there!"
7237079,12787456,2017-04-21T01:08:28Z,"The house is mostly as you see in the picture, thoughtfully built, eco and bright. Hide San's family is warm and lovely. "
7237079,3021475,2017-03-24T01:28:49Z,"An extraordinary place. I can recommend to anyone who is curious.

I stayed for 10 days and did not yet begin to learn from the library, from Hidenori, who is deeply connected to this place, this time, what is possible, what should be seen, what is invisible.

The experience of being there is being at home. Warm, comfortable, friendly, engaged.

It will be a great joy to return."
7237079,24928620,2017-02-22T01:03:42Z,"This is the second time for me to stay is Kyodo house.

For sure, this is a great experience for me again. Kyodo house is a very unique building, if you like design, here is a great place to stay. I chat quite a lot different things with Hide and Ayumi and Sola is a cute and happy girl haha:)!

No worry, Kyodo house is a good choice for you haha!



"
7237079,64501067,2017-02-12T23:49:15Z,"It's a wonderful experience staying with Hide, his lovely family and mates. We can't thank you enough for letting us be part of the lovely house for the past week. We appreciate how you guys have involved us in everything - art events, yoga (too bad we've missed that), and the homemade breakfast that had made our day. 

My personal favourite is finding everyone at the dining table when we came back, discussing the creative projects being worked on, with toothbrushes in the mouths. We appreciate all the recommendations you guys have given, and every little detail (from the morning music to the flyers to art events in the washroom to the little worms that generate natural fertilizers) has made our vacation exceptionally unforgettable. 

We surely hope to return in the near future, if you let us :) And I'm already missing little Miss Sola! "
7237079,1211033,2016-11-11T02:42:08Z,Hide and his family are the ultimate hosts. There home is an impressive work of design. Staying in Setagaya really makes you feel like a local. When you stay with them you feel like part of the family :)
7237079,24928620,2016-11-01T02:20:23Z,"Just wanna say everything happened in Kyodo house bring us so many good memories! Kyodo house is a really cool house with cool architecture. Hide and Ayumi are really nice that we chat a lot about different culture, and their daughter is really cute haha:)

Kyodo is a convenient place to stay,
as it located closely from shibuya, and just around 30 mins to Tokyo station. 

We do enjoy staying here. if that is possible, we want to live here again! Hope to see you guys again!

"
7237079,8073232,2016-10-16T23:48:02Z,"This house is absolutely amazing. Stunning modern architecture. The area is great, a beautiful Tokyo suburb. Lovely walk to the train station through the local shops and restaurants. All in all a great place to stay. 

The hosts are really lovely and very interesting people. We also met other people staying at the house which was really nice.

The experience is one of coming into someone else's house almost as a family member, the hosts don't go to any extra effort to keep the place meticulously tidy, so I imagine for some people that may be a problem. It wasn't for us. In fact I quite liked the ""normal"" nature of the experience. It's definitely not like living in a hotel, which I liked.

There is one thing to be wary of - although they say it’s a non-smoking household, the host does actually smoke, albeit outside, but if smoking is not your thing, bear that in mind. It did take us by surprise!

If you are wanting to stay in an amazing house in a great area and want to meet some interesting people and don't mind a bit of domestic goings-on, this is the place for you. 
"
7237079,554413,2016-10-13T00:05:58Z,"Hide was a amazing, kind host and we felt very welcome in his gorgeous home. The stay was comfortable and we really enjoyed working and cooking in the common spaces, meeting some other housemates and his wonderful daughter.

The entire home is an experience in itself and we loved learning about the design and architecture. The neighborhood is not too far from central Tokyo and a nice retreat for a few days to enjoy a more local flavor.

If you have the chance, stay with Hide and his family for one the best airbnb experiences you can have in Tokyo."
7237079,35628461,2016-10-10T10:16:28Z,"Where to start! I feel like I know Tokyo now and that is thanks to Hide and his wonderful friends and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). Beautiful house with a great story, in a residential semi-suburban neighborhood, close to nice restaurants and a ten min walk to the station. Hide was so helpful and generous. He was great to talk to but also did his own thing. The general house situation is definately radical chic; it is not spotless, but all is made with great taste. I look forward to staying there again in a few months' time. "
7237079,4229756,2016-09-19T01:33:29Z,I can't say enough about how amazing my stay at Hidenori's home was. The house is beautiful - an architectural wonder. By far the highlight of the trip was how welcoming and friendly Hidenori and his friends and family were. I got to experience a few days in their life - meeting artist friends and joining tasty home cooked meals. Thank you for the awesome stay! I would love to come back one day.
7237079,53638057,2016-08-03T00:04:56Z,"Great home, fantastic hosts and recommendations to some of the best food in Tokyo. Worth staying a little out of the downtown for a real experience of living in Japan."
7237079,440612,2016-04-20T00:36:18Z,One of our favorite Airbnb stays so far! The architecture and details are stunning and the house feels calm and beautiful. The hosts gave the perfect experience and are generous with opening their space to strangers. Would love to come back again one day. 
7237079,52752792,2016-01-22T12:20:28Z,"It was a great experience living in Kyodo house with Hide and his family. The house is great with sufficient space but a little bit cold in winter in the basement. I like the neighbourhood, it's very convenient, many good food and almost no tourists. Hope to go back again sometimes. "
7237079,53378369,2016-01-17T13:54:09Z,"Nice house, friendly host, provide many suggestion for local food and art museums 
Not very far from station
The room is in basement, so may be a little bit cold, but there is a heater if you need "
7237079,41852777,2016-01-11T12:45:59Z,"This home is a gem. The hosts are amazing people, smart, interesting, kind, cultured and well travelled. The house is perfectly represented by the photos, what you see is very accurate. Since this is a shared home with a young kid I would only suggest it to those who wish to be part of such dynamics. Similarly, I would mainly -if not exclusively- recommend Kyodo house to art and culture addicts, food geeks, and architect lovers.
I love this area of Tokyo because is is calm  and far from the madness of Shibuya.  "
7237079,5470769,2015-12-31T12:43:03Z,"It was GREAT. Perfect actually, just as what we expected to be hosted at a Japanese/yet international Airbnb home. The guest room was very spacious with traditional Japanese bed, wooden table and aroma candles. The whole house has a modern design with natural lighting, impressive surround-sound system, plus advanced appliances. Thanks to their hospitality. Hide had provided a new heater for extra warmth and Ayumi gave me yogurt for breakfast Morning. Also, we were also delighted to be invited to the end of year parties of the house in the last days of 2015, it was a such amazing experience that we will never forget. "
7237079,2784922,2015-12-22T11:37:09Z,We really enjoyed our stay here and Hidenori was a wonderful host and showed us around the neighbourhood when we arrived. The location is a close walking distance to the station with plenty of restaurants along the way. 
7237079,659773,2015-11-25T16:23:51Z,"Everything perfectly as described, beautiful house, nice location and Hidenori & family are very good hosts. Would totally stay with them again."
7237079,17382151,2015-11-16T13:14:36Z,"Kyodo House was a great experience - we loved the design of the house (being architects it was of great interest to us) and the hosts were very helpful and hospitable, we really enjoyed our stay. "
1753791,127216519,2017-04-28T12:40:00Z,"Great location, lovely retro style, felt really at home. We appreciated Evelina's recommendations for local food and shops, we enjoyed a fab meal at the community cafe! 
We walked along the embankment into London city on day with the knowledge that it wasn't too far from Evelina's helpful & detailed information pack and it was so lovely. 
We had a great time thank you."
1753791,117434067,2017-04-26T12:47:18Z,Nice place and Evelina is still host friendly!

1753791,33032293,2017-04-23T09:53:12Z,Our stay at Evelina's flat was so good. We had a great time in London and enjoyed a stroll around Big Ben in the mornings. Unfortunately we didn't meet her but the communication was perfect. We would stay here again! :)
1753791,105935828,2017-04-21T10:59:05Z,Very quaint place in the perfect location!  Host is very accommodating and understanding if you need to drop off bags early.  Evelina gave us some wonderful suggestions for things to do/places to go in the area. 
1753791,2353113,2017-04-13T09:40:06Z,Evelina is a very nice person and her charming apartment is very well located!
1753791,76779045,2017-04-10T08:12:21Z,"Tolle Unterkunft, auch beim 2. Mal. Sehr citynah mit allem was man braucht in unmittelbarer Nähe. Ein toller Ort für ein Wochenende in London. Es war sauber und ordentlich und wir würden auch noch ein 3. Mal hinfahren. "
1753791,13732239,2017-04-03T09:11:56Z,"l'appartement est vraiment charmant, la decoration est un vrai atout, on se sent ailleurs!
le petit inconvenient est que les 2 chambres sont assez proches et que ce nest pas forcement bien insonorisé!
mais nous avons beaucoup apprecié l'ensemble du logement!
nous reviendrons avec plaisir!

1753791,114478351,2017-03-30T09:27:23Z,"The place was in a good location, just across the river from Big Ben, and is beautifully decorated and furnished. The host offered great suggestions for places to eat and sightsee, and she responded quickly to any questions I had."
1753791,108886661,2017-03-28T07:09:24Z,"Evelina's house is in a quiet place, very close to Westminster ! Comfortable and clean! I recommend it for both short and long stay! Evelina is very nice and she will give you all the information that you'll need! Enjoy ! "
1753791,120372121,2017-03-27T08:35:33Z,Great little apartment just a stones throw from some major sites. Checked in early and Evelina catered to everything we needed. Strongly recommended.
1753791,118635438,2017-03-24T11:09:28Z,"Had a very good stay here and liked the decor very much. The pub around the corner is very nice, especially for breakfast. Quite a long walk from the station but not too far. Would recommend the room."
1753791,31945507,2017-03-23T10:15:38Z,"I really enjoyed staying in Evelina's flat. The flat is close to everything and is about a 15 minutes walk to Big Ben
 and the House of Parliament, The London Eye, Sea Life, public transportation, and so much more. There are also some great places to eat within walking distance and a cute park across the street. The flat itself is adorable and charming with the true European experience. Would stay here again in a heart beat. "
1753791,21807668,2017-03-18T10:35:47Z,"It's a lovely vintage room near the (URL HIDDEN) not big but tidy and quiet.Evelina offered us some free toast,jam,fruits and ice cream.We appreciate it:)She was very thoughtful to introduce how to get to the flat,what to see and where to eat in the neighborhood before we came.The flat is not far away from Big Ben.It just takes less than 20 minutes by walking.And it only takes 10-15minutes to walk to Vauxhall underground (Victoria Line).Vauxhall is also a train station. It's very convenient to go out.
Love this place.will come again on my next trip in London.Thank you so much Evelina!Hope to see you around."

Evelina herself was delightful, helpful and made sure we were happy, comfortable and looked after. We only stayed for one night but I could have honestly spent a week there the bed was so comfortable. The cafe directly over the road was also fabulous for breakfast. Thanks so much Evelina for a lovely stay! "
1753791,114668165,2017-03-03T10:39:44Z,Everything was great. Evelina help us with storing our luggage because we came to London earlier that the check in time. She is very helpful and you feel at home in her place. The bed was very confortable. We enjoyed our stay in London because of the how nice the place was. Even for one night stay ... I will remember it!
1753791,51763268,2017-03-02T09:06:05Z,"The location was absolutely perfect. Close to Vauxhall, close to the city itself and it was a beautiful room.

161231,122469563,2017-05-01T07:21:31Z,"Place was very cute, cozy and very near restos, shopping area and Shibuya station. Instructions by the host was pretty much on point and helpful. The pad was small but in a nice way its a great experience of a tiny home living. 

Its unfortunate we did not meet up with LP and John but maybe some other time. 

One area for improvement, if there is any, would be the pillows. We felt it was a bit hard .. But other than this our stay was perfect. 

Highly recommendable "

161231,44007,2017-04-10T00:56:48Z,"LP provided us with something you cannot usually just buy: a friendly reception from a local who is happy to provide guidance, recommendations, and tips which ultimately saved us time and money. This is above and beyond the place itself, which is adorable, design-oriented, hand-crafted, and full of charm — think Design Within Reach + Tiny House movement. Highly recommend "
161231,51984149,2017-04-05T23:58:50Z,"I love LP & John's place, although it's quite small for 3 people XD but I love their place a lot especially the interior, the mini kitchen and fridge. 
It's very near the train station and the very famous shibuya crossing. I like how the neighborhood is quiet and at the same time very accessible to the lit shibuya. 
As for LP and John, they are very informative and easy to communicate. I would love to stay at their place again ❤ "
161231,1251097,2017-03-26T23:27:27Z,"Great little designer space with all the basic necessities. Nothing high-end, but it's a uniquely designed apartment that's very quite and comfortable. Incredibly close to Shibuya station and About Life Coffee Brewers for your morning pick-me-up. Easy check in as well!"
161231,178219,2017-03-17T01:40:37Z,"Great location, really close to the subway and to Shibuya. The place was great, had a great DIY aesthetic. "
161231,6564566,2017-02-28T01:32:29Z,"Lp's apartment was such a unique experience. We love the effort they put into building the apartment themselves and adding all the details like hand-drawn house manual and map with local recommendations. Had such a creative, cosy vibe. There was 3 of us and we fit fine in this small apartment. Probably more suitable for 2 people for a more comfortable stay. The pocket wifi left for us to use was a total life saver while exploring Tokyo! Check in was easy and location was great. We had a great time and would highly recommend Lp's place! Thanks again Lp for sharing your lovely home! :)"
161231,17842860,2017-01-30T00:19:20Z,"We had a fantastic stay in this apartment. The apartment is a bit tricky to find as Shibuya is a maze but LP and John provided to help locate it. They have styled the property very well and my favourite touch was the CD player mounted on the wall, just pull the string for instant enjoyment. The location is manic but beautiful, walk far enough down the street and stumble upon another beautiful neighbourhood. We had a breakfast at Ivy which was expensive but nice! There are too many great local eateries to try and LP and John give some amazing recommendations."
161231,109756970,2017-01-27T01:58:42Z,"Evee though I had never met any of John &Lp. But I still feel very close with them.

intimate hotel and quiet atmosphere, look forward to seeing the next."

161231,18261383,2016-12-27T01:52:39Z,"公寓距离涩谷商圈非常近,步行时间在十分钟以内。房间非常有设计感,看的出主人的用心和生活情趣。被子稍微有点点小,但不影响使用。还有电热毯可以使用哦~门口的小柜子内有齐全的生活日用品;屋内电器也蛮全的,但是没有找到电热水壶有点可惜哦。阳台种了小植物,可以在那里抽烟~墙壁上的CD播放机我很喜欢~垃圾需要进行分类放到楼下餐厅旁边的垃圾箱内~如果你想体验当地人的生活、逛逛年轻人的街区、在涩谷购物,这里会是很棒的选择~"
161231,71873133,2016-12-22T23:11:46Z,"The apartment decoration was really adorable. It was clean and had all the things we needed. It is located very close to main shibuya. Steps away from restaurants and 24 hours convenience store, so it was great. Lp and John also helped to recommend local places to visit and we had a great time!"
161231,29441247,2016-12-18T00:09:01Z,"We had such an incredible stay in LP's cute little home. The location was amazing, central and only a few minutes walk from Shibuya station. The apartment had everything we could need and was adorably decorated. The pocket wifi was excellent and LP provided great suggestions on things to do. Would highly recommend! "
161231,28839786,2016-12-14T01:29:16Z,"I have just spent a very enjoyable 8 nights at LP & John's lovely, comfortable, immaculate, peaceful apartment. I didn't want to leave. I would definitely return to stay in the future. The location is magnificent - just a very short walk to the main Shibuya action and Subway station, with Daikanyama and Nakameguro also being within easy walking distance. 

And, there's a superb indie coffee kiosk a few mins away 'About Life' on the main Dougenzaka road down to Shibuya crossing .. always a great way to start the day! 

Highly recommended :))"
161231,23311900,2016-12-04T01:49:41Z,"LP was an excellent host and the place was great! The location was very convenient, and even though the inside was a bit small, it was a well-designed and unique space. Would recommend!"
161231,75803212,2016-11-30T11:13:22Z,"Perfect location for shopping, nightlife and nearby JR railway service. Lp and John are amazing hosts that are more than accomodating. Couldn't recommend more!!"
161231,84814255,2016-11-21T09:59:01Z,"Hosts were super nice and responded to messages fast, recommended a lot of good places for food, sightsee, and explore etc. Place was clean. Would book this again next time (:"
161231,1746587,2016-11-10T02:58:41Z,Super appartment in a really nice area. Creativity in decorating and handling the small space. One lttle remark: the bed is really small for two tall Dutch persons! 
161231,11673197,2016-11-06T01:35:53Z,"LP and john were fantastic hosts.  They provided in depth info for how to get to their place, and all the fun that can be had in the surrounding neighbourhood.  The apartment is beautiful, funky, and in a perfect location.  Lp was also super accommodating with check out.  Couldn't recommend more!"
8175257,26892631,2017-05-01T23:15:17Z,The apartment is wonderful!
8175257,81759911,2017-04-27T01:52:03Z,"Very good house, you can have a very good time here with your friends or family"
8175257,25096377,2017-04-17T08:20:15Z,"Everything  is  great,convenient  and easy to go anywhere,supermarket  jus around the corner,and ramen and Chinese restaurant along the road,Dotonburi 10 min walk,good for 6 to 8 people, Tom n jo will respond to u as soon as possible if there any problems."
8175257,93972263,2017-04-02T02:54:52Z,"The location is perfect. There are plenty of convenience store and 24 hr restaurants.
It's near the station and 15 minutes walk to dotonburi."
8175257,70618687,2017-03-23T23:29:58Z,Agréable maison pour loger à Osaka!
8175257,99984782,2017-03-20T00:48:11Z,"一整栋楼都是你的,几个小伙伴一起出行很舒服,四辆自行车也是棒棒的~"
8175257,106646107,2017-03-09T01:04:26Z,"A cosy and quiet place to leave near Dotonbori.
And Tom is very helpfull."
8175257,47301247,2017-03-01T00:57:49Z,"離車站大約十分鐘路程,民宿附近也有二十四小時超市,交通方便,民宿內也相當舒適與提供的房間圖片差不多,蠻適合家庭旅遊居住"
8175257,108214067,2017-02-20T01:37:30Z,"Great Place, stay here."
8175257,37312197,2017-02-13T03:21:33Z,"步行到心斋桥,道顿崛最多15分钟。走快点10分钟。步行到黑门市场约20分钟。交通十分便利。路口就是全家,不远处有一个当地人超市。马桶盖好舒服!!!不足的是,浴室只有一个。但是厕所有两个。一二楼空调有点打不起来。总体来说TOM的房源真的不错。"
8175257,76521767,2017-01-31T23:12:27Z,This is a great place for families.
8175257,106660658,2017-01-26T23:02:04Z,어른 8명이서 갔습니다. 사진과 싱크로율이 매우 높습니다. 일본식 주택의 특징일지는 모르겠지만 벽이 얇아 조용히 안하면 옆집에 다 들릴거 같다는 게 느껴집니다. 지도상으로 난바역까지 지하철 두정거장이라하는데 걸어서 5분안에 진짜로 갈 수 있습니다. 강추!
8175257,31197329,2017-01-23T01:03:51Z,"This house in Osaka is amazing! Has everything we needed and more. Spacious, warm (we visited in winter) and very comfortable. Communication was easy and quick. The best thing is the location, close to the busy and lively parts of the city (Dotonbori) but is in a quiet area. Definitely stay here if you visit Osaka. We loved it :)"
8175257,96520321,2017-01-17T23:41:04Z,Tom house is very clean and cozy!
8175257,73290554,2017-01-10T23:16:12Z,"空間雖然不大,但是該有的東西都有了,附近有個超市,可以很方便的買東西回來烹煮!整個空間佈置得很溫馨,入住馬上就有家的感覺!距離心齋橋與道頓堀有點距離,相對之下也比較安靜!"
8175257,11215801,2017-01-06T07:49:08Z,"Tom's place was perfect for our family of 5. The directions offered to find the house were very helpful. The space inside was a great size for us and the house provided us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location was great. We could walk to Osaka Castle, Dotonbori and the subway station. Family Mart down the road was handy for the family too. We definitely recommend Tom's place to all families heading to Osaka. This was our first taste of Japan and we loved it. "
8175257,24388325,2016-12-31T00:28:57Z,"Tom's place was neat and clean, just like how it was described! Communication with Tom was smooth, and he was helpful. The apartment was located within walking distance from the main tourist areas, and easily accessible. 

It was a very cosy place for the 9 of us, and we enjoyed the stay! Will be back here if we are in Osaka again. Thanks Tom! :)"
8175257,27466621,2016-12-27T23:38:57Z,Enjoyed our stay and highly recommended! 
8175257,24849999,2016-12-19T09:28:15Z,"We had a good stay at Tom's house. The house is very nice, exactly as shown in the photo. Location is good, and there is 24 hrs convenient store nearby. Highly recommend Tom's house if you visit Osaka with family."
8175257,37771063,2016-12-10T03:24:39Z,"Tom had definitely taken the time to prepare directions to the apartment and simple rules to follow.  Most things are clearly marked too.

First thing you'll notice about the place is the owners had taken their time to decorate the apartment and make it as comfortable as possible for visitors.  For an apartment in the city I must say it is quite spacious and the host providing the portable wifi is a plus especially for tourists.  

The kitchen and dining is adequately equipped.  The 2 bed rooms have enough space for 2 small families and the room in the top floor has a small balcony too.  The bicycles are also a nice plus too.  

The location of the apartment is also quite strategic.  It's within walking distance to Dontoburi, Den den town, Kuramon market and other attractions around.  Restaurants are a plenty too. The closest subway station is only a 5 minute walk away.  

If you are looking for a decently sized and well equipped apartment then this would be one you should seriously consider."
3755988,121713387,2017-05-11T14:53:06Z,"Super séjour avec Lindy et Gavin, ils ont été très accueillant chaleureux. La terrasse avec vue sur l océan est magique. "
3755988,55888576,2017-05-05T11:11:20Z,"The stay was great and the hosts did a good job of making me feel at home. The neighborhood has great views of the ocean and Table Mountain during the day, and you get awesome views of the stars at night since there are no street lights."
3755988,3961359,2017-05-01T09:00:19Z,This location offers great value for money. The room was a bit small but we had unhindered access to the rest of the house and the property which made up for this.
3755988,34223490,2017-04-19T08:56:15Z,One of the best Airbnb houses in he world. Breathtaking location with amazing views and amazing interior decor. 
3755988,35714880,2017-04-14T06:44:39Z,"We had an amazing time at Lindy and Gavin's! It is a beautiful get away from the city with amazing views on the sea and the mountains in the back. They offered plenty of space to feel comfortable around and we enjoyed lots of time sitting outside on our patio for breakfast, watching the sunsets or enjoying a glass of wine accompanied by the cute dog Max and the cat :) The beach is just a ten minute walk away. Since Llandudno is a quiet neighbourhood and a 25 minute drive into the city (there are shops ten minutes away in Hout Bay though)it is helpful to have a car around. We are very glad that we could spend our last days in Capetown in this lovely home and hope to be back one day! :)"
3755988,118316740,2017-04-07T08:20:41Z,I had a wonderful stay with Lindy and Gavin.  The room is lovely and the deck has the most magical views.  Its all very relaxed and Lindy is just fabulous.  Only wish I had longer to stay and enjoy another chat with Lindy

3755988,114282617,2017-03-19T09:45:35Z,"Very beautiful home and two amazingly interesting hosts. The covered verandah is one of the most amazing places to eat, drink and just watch the sunset. Loved it! 
"
3755988,16368136,2017-03-14T06:41:55Z,It was a great pleasure to stay and Lindy's and Gavin's house. Very friendly and relaxed hosts. Beautiful house with amazing view. I would definitely visit those wonderful people  again!
3755988,8768522,2017-03-02T07:14:04Z,"We absolutely loved staying at Lindy and Gavin's home! We felt very welcome and both were very friendly and helpful. Max, their dog, makes everything just perfect! The view you can enjoy from the terrace is incredible! We will stay again!!! "
3755988,38738669,2017-02-28T09:50:07Z,"The house ist just as beautiful as in the pictures, the view is a dream, our room was very cute, clean and comfortable and Lindy and Gavin were super nice and very helpful! We had a super comfortable stay, the area is very quiet and peaceful and the beach only a few minutes away. We would come back any time! "

3755988,45796271,2017-02-12T08:22:33Z,"That place is definitely the most beautiful airbnb we've ever been in. Everything is literally perfect. The house is spacious and very clean, it's very stylishly furnished, you have the best view and it's only a short walk to the beach. The lovely hosts made us feel like it's our home from the very beginning. We also fell in love with their very cute dog Max straight away. We could only stay for 2 nights, but we'll definitely come back. Thank you for having us "
3755988,68658131,2017-01-29T08:19:35Z,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, only problem being it was too short! Lindy and Gavin were amazing hosts, very helpful and friendly. We found it very comfortable there, and also  well situated, als got to see a few whales!"
3755988,112539022,2017-01-23T08:32:15Z,A nice place with the perfect view!!
3755988,4403011,2017-01-21T09:44:10Z,"Superb location, unbelievable place, adorable kind welcoming and warm hosts, dream holiday-home away from home. If you're lucky enough to find this gem available for the days you're in Cape Town, don't think about it twice! We would have stayed longer if only we could have, and already planning to come back!
Absolute icing of our 3-week South-African honey moon, best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Thanks again Lindy and Gavin, you are the most amazing people! "
3755988,1918422,2017-01-16T08:18:29Z,"The house is beautiful, light and airy. The bedroom, however, is small and on the first floor with little natural light. Linda and Gavin recognize this and have made an effort to provide lots of access to the porch upstairs which makes up for the small room downstairs.  Llandudno is beautiful, and the beaches are fantastic. "
4208816,123136134,2017-04-29T03:42:26Z,"Darunee's place was amazing, had all u need nice and cozy the customer service was A1 top of the line they were so nice and helpful wifi worked great every was as expected accurate to the pictures. The staff even made sure our uber driver was who he said he was by matching license plate number and photo I thought that showed that they really cared for they guest. I would definitely stay again next time I'm in Bangkok and highly recommend it if ur in town and don't have more than 3-4 guests worked great for our daughter she loved it as well "
4208816,103949546,2017-04-27T02:00:21Z,"This hotel is quite near the Suvarnabhumi Airport, 10mins shuttle car arrival. The house is cute and service is nice. Good experience. "
4208816,122665659,2017-04-24T07:16:54Z,"到达曼谷住的第一家,主要是凌晨航班,加上要去芭提雅,选择离机场近一点,歇歇;酒店非常漂亮,独立一栋,无不影响,干净整洁,功能完善;非常喜欢!而且服务好!有任何需求,例如包车啥的都可以和服务员说,另外边上的餐厅,也是美味实惠,值得推荐"
4208816,24837333,2017-04-16T02:08:38Z,"If you need a place close to the airport, this is the place for you. We had 15 hours in Bangkok just before heading home and we didn't want to have to worry about finding a taxi at 1am and take 30-45 minutes to get to the airport. This Airbnb feels more like a hotel. They offered an airport shuttle 24 hours a day at a low rate ($4.37 for your whole group) which was so convenient since our concern was trying to find transportation at that time of night. The place was very clean and had air conditioning. The upstairs was very hot and would have been unbearable had their not been a portable AC in there. The bed was a bit uncomfortable, but since we were here less than a day, I didn't spend more then 1-2 hours sleeping in the bed. The customer service here was top notch. We asked for a taxi to one of the outdoor markets closer to the city center and the front desk called one for us. They also negotiated a price for us which was so nice since the first taxi driver tried ripping us off. If you have a lay over or looking to stay close to the airport, I highly suggest this Airbnb. If you want to be close to the city center and all the tourist spots, keep looking because you will be about a 40 minute taxi ride away. "
4208816,112546488,2017-04-15T02:13:59Z,"Tolle Möglichkeit, um günstig in Flughafennähe unterzukommen!"
4208816,103962950,2017-04-14T03:08:41Z,"Very nice villa, we liked it so much and had a very nice trip here... People here all friendly and hopefully, the boy is so lovely, he always smiles and fix all problems for us soon. It was a little hot on the upstairs, but it's ok, beds was comfortable, clean,softly. There are free coffee and tea and food in room.. it was so good. We will come to this hotel again if we come to Thai next time. 很喜欢这个小别墅,我们在这里度过了非常愉悦的两天,工作人员都很友好并且积极帮助我们,特别是前台一个男孩子很可爱,总是面带微笑很温柔的帮我们找车或告诉我们一些攻略。楼上很热,空调吹不上来,不过也还好,有风扇,床很舒适,也很干净,冰箱里有免费的水和咖啡和方便面,晚上饿了很方便。这里很好,下次再来泰国的话希望还是住在这里。"
4208816,82054059,2017-04-10T04:59:25Z,"Near airport, 10mins walk to paseo mall if you want to grab some food or shopping. Cute little villas with clean environment and overall a nice stay.."
4208816,85843562,2017-04-03T02:14:44Z,"Nice and beautiful house
Excellent service Neary by
The BKK"
4208816,25859777,2017-03-29T03:01:15Z,"这个小木屋意外的比照片上看起来还要好,周边都是绿植,感觉像走进了花园里的小别墅。初到曼谷从素万那普国际机场过来很近,但需要打车,但是泰国的司机不太认识地图,所以来的时候最好致电前台,让前台和出租司机沟通。酒店的服务小哥哥们非常细心,会很主动帮忙搬行李,下车还会帮忙检查车上有没有遗漏的东西,这个小细节真的非常贴心。住在这里真的很棒。"
4208816,75555293,2017-03-28T03:14:31Z,Nice!!!!!
4208816,38704158,2017-03-23T01:04:33Z,这是带有公寓楼和小木屋的民宿 我们一行三人 定了一间带阁楼的小木屋 从素万那普机场打车到这里150泰铢 转机住这里很方便 前台登记时给个表格 可以直接选择是否需要接送机和是否需要早餐 房间干净 淋浴水温正好 洗完澡美美地睡了一晚上 对了 这里的服务很好 我们一下出租车就有服务生来帮忙拿行李 前台办理入住也很快 然后服务生拿着行李领我们去小木屋 第二天去机场坐中巴车也有人帮忙装行李 非常满意
4208816,62035788,2017-03-18T03:34:18Z,"离素万那普机场只有十分钟的车程,交通便利。前台的接待人员都很热情周到。小木屋干净整洁,房间里的各种配套设施都很齐全,还有免费的泡面和奶茶可以吃。可惜来的时候已经晚上了,第二天一大早又得赶飞机,没有办法好好感受一下这里的氛围。"
4208816,94242953,2017-03-17T01:54:41Z,Bonne alternative quand on veut juste dormir une nuit avant de reprendre un vol. 10 mins de l aéroport en taxi. 150 baths pour le taxi. Endroit calme. Literie confortable et logement très fonctionnel. Pas très adapté si ok veut visiter Bangkok car très loin du centre ville. 
4208816,5402203,2017-03-16T01:05:19Z,Great place close to the airport. Convenient shuttle service too! We loved our stay!
4208816,70177007,2017-03-12T02:16:10Z,Close to the airport and wonderful place to stay
4208816,46188362,2017-03-01T02:28:35Z,"Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice place near the Suvarnabhumi airport. 
The resort is so idyllic and really perfect for vacation. It also provides breakfast set only 90B."
4208816,96580402,2017-02-28T04:32:35Z,Great for overnight stays prior to flights!
4208816,44880499,2017-02-26T02:05:38Z,"Darunee's place was stunning. Although we only stayed for one night, everything was exactly as it was advertised. The staff was very help and the villas were chic and clean. We would definitely stay here again. "
4208816,114448421,2017-02-21T02:12:43Z,"It's so convenient to find the hotel from the airport, but if I have another chance to choose, the hotel adjacent to this house would be my preference."
4208816,99728450,2017-02-19T04:41:21Z,"因为抵达曼谷临近午夜,次日清晨又要早起搭飞机,所以订了这间靠近机场的民宿。严格来说,这是一个度假村或者别墅式的酒店公寓群,我们预订的是其中一间小木屋。出发前收到店家的邮件,按他们的要求回复了我们的航班信息,店家也回复了shuttle bus的信息,出了到达厅之后,按照店家的描述,很容易就找到了如期等候的Toyota面包车。车程不到20分钟,就抵达住地。小木屋外有一个香气四溢的花园,夜里闻起来特别惬意。房间有两层,一层是双人床,二层是单人床,二层灯光略昏暗,但床铺还比较舒服,房屋格局很适合我们这次一个年轻人+两位老人的家庭出游。浴室水温够热,房间里还有免费的食物和饮料。可惜不能好好体会小木屋的清晨,也来不及吃到这里的早餐就要离开。另外需要提醒的是,这家店的服务员对中文订单的处理能力比较低,入住时他们告诉我,他们是连蒙带猜才把airbnb发过来的订单上的中文名跟邮件里的英文名对上号的…发邮件给他们时最好备注一下自己中文名跟汉语拼音的对应关系。"
2892435,14340579,2017-05-10T13:14:54Z,"The apartment is incredible, the views are unparalleled, but the glasses and plateware are a little difficult to find. Highly recommend!"
2892435,32771786,2017-05-09T14:21:49Z,"Such a fun place to stay in Paris! The pictures are all very accurate, except the view is much more than a picture can portray. We enjoyed ourselves immensely!"
2892435,112193548,2017-04-18T03:59:54Z,The host canceled this reservation 170 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2892435,113765623,2017-04-16T09:11:34Z," Fantastic apartment with even greater views of the Eiffel tower   To check in with smooth and without flaws, the apartment was clean and orderly everything that was expected. I would definitely recommend it"
2892435,117352443,2017-04-12T07:34:55Z,Location!! This place has an amazing views of the Eiffel Tower and Champ Elysee. We are so glad that we decided to stay at this location.

2892435,31560711,2017-03-09T07:16:33Z,"John's apartment is an absolute dream. You feel like the Eiffel Tower is in your living room. Beautiful views, comfortable space, and John is very good at communicating and keeping you happy. Staying here made my stay that much better! "
2892435,3395877,2017-03-04T07:56:29Z,The location and the view were equally awesome! I felt the apartment was a bit dated especially the toilet but the view made up for everything - it was a fabulous stay overall.
2892435,87849622,2017-02-25T08:37:37Z,The views are breathtaking.  Even better than the pictures. The Location is amazing.  Working with John was easy.  He is quick to respond to questions and and everything worked out quite well. We had an amazing time in Paris.  
2892435,42499034,2017-02-14T09:56:08Z,"This apartment was everything promised by the pictures. Conveniently located within the city, and views of the Eiffel Tour at sunrise, daytime, sunset, and night. We look forward to staying here again!"

2892435,48271389,2017-01-20T07:16:14Z,"Great modern 1 bedroom, amazing views of Paris from multiple balconies. Worth it for the views alone (which is about all you get in January since it's so cold!) "
2892435,36267878,2017-01-17T09:17:13Z,"Very ogogogogoogod
Place i love it"
2892435,769935,2017-01-13T09:24:59Z,"My boyfriend and I have stayed at John's place for a quick 3 night getaway in January 2017. It was super cold! But the house was always warm and cozy and it was great returning to it at the end of a long rainy day. We arrived very early in the morning the first day and left late at night the last day. Both times we were able to leave our luggage with the doorman, who is a sweet guy, who held them for us while we explored Paris before check in and after check out. The view is absolutely perfect and it was great to hop outside to get croissants (lots of bakeries in the immediate vicinity) then make a little nespresso (the machine is there and we bought capsules at the market down the street) and then have breakfast overlooking the Eiffel Tower from the apartment before leaving for the day. We had a magical time!"
2892435,96826378,2017-01-10T08:04:54Z,The place was exactly like it's described.. very good view 
2892435,7221091,2017-01-06T07:27:45Z,"The Apartment is GREAT! This is actually my 2nd time at John's place, the first time was 3 years ago when i went for my pre-wedding photoshoot in Paris, and we stumbled into his apartment by accident ( my photographer was staying here ) and since then, we decided that IF we ever go to Paris again, it will be at John's place, and so we did this time for our honeymoon!

The view was CRAZY, if there's a 6* rating available, i would have given one! U get 4 balconies with all of Paris in view, it couldnt be any better than this! Totally speechless, as i sat on the balcony, looking at eiffel (even though its freezing outside when i visited Paris, it was -3/-5 degree) i forgotten about the cold.

totally would stay here again the next time i have the chance!"
2892435,9726218,2017-01-01T10:59:43Z,"The most beautiful views of Paris. The perfect place to spend New Years, it was such a treat. Most wonderful view off of the balconies. "
690600,95647256,2017-05-02T11:36:07Z,Thank you Ivo for being such a nice host.. Ivo is great host and very helpful. Everything was perfect. Thank you again for making the trip so comfortable and memorable.

690600,6484566,2017-04-21T11:50:15Z,"Ivo's cosy apartment was our home for a night. It was close to the city centre and very convenient. We parked our car at a parking street that was 5 minutes away from the apartment and it was free of charge. He also gave us some tips about island hopping. Also, he welcomed us with a bottle of strawberry liquer that his wife made and it was yummy (and perfect for the weather!)"
690600,13092026,2017-04-20T12:56:43Z,Ivo's place was perfectly located 5 min from the palace and market. Ivo greeted us and helped us with parking. We also shared a shot of homemade strawberry brandy with him on arrival which was lovely! 
690600,73287017,2017-04-16T08:35:39Z,"Accueil chaleureux et généreux de Ivo. Appartement charmant, propre, bien placé par rapport au centre historique de Split, quartier calme. Nous avons vraiment apprécié notre séjour."

690600,25850320,2017-03-27T08:42:39Z,"Perfectly located on a quiet side street in a central location. Close to main bus station, old town and beaches. Ivo was great with the check in and even picked us up from the bus station. Perfect for a quiet home base in split. "
690600,25723498,2017-03-22T07:12:36Z,"Ivo's studio apartment was very clean and convenient. He was super helpful, found us a park & carried both of our bags. We had a great time in Split. "

690600,20166590,2017-03-11T10:11:01Z,숙소가는 길에 계단이 좀 있어 캐리어를 갖고 있을때 불편할수 있지만 호스트가 도와주기때문에 많이 힘들지 않아요. 집안에 그늘이 있어 3월달에는 밤에 좀 추울수 있어요.
690600,56652915,2017-02-20T10:12:33Z,"The best apartment I stayed at in Europe. Clean, spacious, modern. Ivo is the best."

690600,110569799,2017-01-23T09:24:50Z,"Me and my friend were staying at Ivo's place for three days. The place was beautiful, clean and perfect for getting away  from the noise of everyday life. Ivo was great host, he showed us the place and helped us to find parking, gave us a map and told us good places to eat and visit. Also he gave us home-made liquor which was delicious. Definitely would stay here again."
690600,79803114,2017-01-15T02:43:54Z,Great little place to relax in. Ivo was very helpful and made sure we had everything for a comfortable stay.

690600,23680655,2016-11-02T09:18:42Z,"Ivo made a point to give us a warm welcome on our first day in Croatia! After showing us around the apartment, he treated us to some homemade traditional cherry wine, a testament to his great hospitality!"
690600,7380125,2016-11-01T07:15:04Z,Great communication. Ivo and family are very understanding and friendly hosts.

And Good alcohol :)
Split is a nice city"
690600,60240846,2016-10-22T07:12:23Z,"Ivo is a very kind and generous person. He picked us up from the harbour. It was early so he took us to a café for a morning coffee, then took us to the apartment. The place is great. No complaints whatsoever.  Perfect location. Amazing hub to explore split. Thanks Ivo! "
5978535,48149599,2017-05-10T07:34:47Z,This apartment is amazing for location to down town sites and with a fabulous view of Table Mountain. Extremely comfortable with everything you need. Loved it !
5978535,38119241,2017-05-03T08:37:04Z,"Very nice apartment, stayed there for the second time and will be back for sure!"
5978535,31275798,2017-04-27T14:11:18Z,The location at the heart of the CBD and the convenient check in process is perfect for business travel. The apartment itself has everything one could ask for. Will definitely be back! Thanks Charmaine! 
5978535,98211346,2017-04-02T07:35:30Z,"Having not stayed in the inner city before, Apartment 1003 was a true gem. My wife and I enjoyed every minute. The interior of the apartment is amazing, with neat, stylish finishes. The view of table mountain, breathtaking. 
Thank you."
5978535,39909771,2017-03-18T08:35:53Z,"The most beautiful apartment, with lovely taste in furnishings and essentials. Could not take my eyes off the view"
5978535,62504666,2017-03-02T06:06:45Z,"A great place to stay, felt right at home, just wished we had a week instead of 2 nights.  Would definitely book it again and loved Cape Town"
5978535,8617536,2017-02-22T06:26:15Z,"This place is incredible - clean, comfortable, beautiful, safe, great location for walking to dinner. Charmaine was quick to respond. "
5978535,33657871,2017-02-19T06:33:34Z,"We are using this apartment each time we go for business in Cape Town. It is central and well connected, private parking makes it easier with a rented car. The apartment is elegantly furnished and has a great view on the city. It has everything one needs (but a sewing kit....). Five star stay!"
5978535,16048151,2017-02-18T05:46:51Z,"We had 6 days at Charmaine's flat and expected a lot from the glowing reviews and photos.  We had superb communication from Charmaine before arrival with details of access, parking etc.  When we arrived we easily obtained the keys and parked in the underground car park.  The flat was stunning with huge picture windows giving  amazing views of Table mountain with ever changing colours.  It was more roomy than we expected with a huge sitting room/dining area and kitchen.  All the furniture and fittings were of the highest quality and beautifully co-ordinated.  The bedroom and bathroom were equally spacious and had everything you could possibly need.  The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept very well.  The shower was very large and powerful - a real luxury!  The kitchen had everything you could need and the TV was large with DSTV and an excellent collection of DVDs.  On top of all this, there was daily housekeeping provided.  The building is in a really good position near all the major downtown  sites and there are several books with information on what to do in the flat.  Additionally Charmaine is always available for advice if requested.  This is a wonderful flat to stay in - it is rare to be unable to think of any improvements that could be made.  We would love to stay again!"
5978535,8590891,2017-02-08T07:21:45Z,"Fantastic apartment, great location. Don't just look at it Book IT. Wish we were here for longer. Pictures don't do it justice, art work just makes it special. Charmaine is a wonderful host with contact etc. "
5978535,75457243,2017-02-05T07:02:04Z,"Great place, very well looked after and immaculately clean. Good location for exploring Cape Town as well"
5978535,71658124,2017-02-02T09:21:45Z,"Charmaine's apartment is in the perfect location for shopping, CT's famous nightlife or as a base for getting out to the wine lands and beaches. We usually stay in de Wanterkant when we visit Cape Town and have never tried Airbnb but are complete converts after staying here! The apartment has incredible views of table mountain and is such a cosy little hideaway to relax in at the end of a busy day. Thank you so much Charmaine, we hope to come back one day!   "
5978535,15509150,2017-01-30T01:59:23Z,GREAT PLACE! Charmaine's place was amazing! The photos do not do it justice. It is beautifully decorated and the view phenomenal. The apartment is in the best location in the city. It is 5 minutes walk from Greenmarket and other restaurants and grocery stores are close. I would 100% recommend anyone looking for a place in Cape Town to stay here. You will not be disappointed 
5978535,3357623,2017-01-26T03:16:20Z,Super apartment in a great location with easy safe parking  Walking distance to the Vand A  Waterfront.
5978535,54024767,2017-01-19T07:12:35Z,It was a really nice apartment. Free parking space is a good for rental car user. Location is also good to look around capetown city center by walk. Room is clean and tidy.  
5978535,56559819,2017-01-12T07:26:53Z,"Lovely central location, within walking distance to many places. Well fitted kitchen and full bathroom with all the extra luxuries of a hotel room. He most amazing view of table mountain from the lounge/kitchen area. Would love to stay again. "
5978535,69616120,2017-01-11T08:27:21Z,"Charmaine's place is as great as advertised - spacious, clean, neatly decorated & with a stunning vista of Table Mountain. Everything went perfectly with getting the keys & access to parking, Charmaine is highly organized & definitely deserves her Superhost status!"
5978535,105370255,2017-01-10T06:06:06Z,"Amazing stay at Charmaine's. The apartment was easy to get into and park. It is a beautiful place. A really nice apartment, I wish I could have stayed longer. Beautifully decorated and an amazing view! Stay here!"
5978535,19664327,2017-01-10T01:58:19Z,"Wow, this apartment is great, we loved it, it's in a central location, clean, beautifully decorated, wonderful restaurant tips, private parking. Bed and pillows are very comfortable, bathroom is large and well equipped with everything you need, a cleaner comes daily. This is the place to stay in Cape Town. "
5978535,50959168,2016-12-19T08:52:28Z,This is a great place that Charmaine has got. The apartment is better than the pictures as well. You have everything that you require. The host is very helpful as well. I would definitely stay here again if I get a chance to.
1298200,85238241,2017-05-09T01:32:45Z,"We had a fabulous stay in K&N's house. It was a truly native experience. The location is not central and that gives the house some added charm. It helps one immerse into the local atmosphere of cafes and shops, offers a walk along the river and challenges  to negotiate the local metro/train system. Try out a local hot spring place which is only about 15 minute walk from the house. What a great experience!

The house was clean and comfortable. Communication with K&N was very efficient. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating. We forgot our glasses on departure for Kyoto. K&N very kindly sent them to our address in our new home there. What an amazing gesture!

Thank you K&N. We would certainly stay again and recommend this place to anyone with an adventurous streak in them ;-) 
"
1298200,26132773,2017-05-04T03:13:59Z,"交通还算便利,离车站也比较近,下车站就是菜市场,有很多吃的,主要房东真的超级无敌好,每天过来问我们有什么需要的,第一天有送很好喝的果汁给我们,最后一天还送我们去aoto 站,很棒的体验,房子也很整洁,干净,舒适,这几天在日本订的民宿都很喜欢,谢谢可爱的房东!"
1298200,79844217,2017-05-01T06:33:26Z,"It was the 2nd time to stay at their property. 

This time was the different house but it was also very cool place!
Now we would love to try all different rooms!
It's always stylish, clean, cosy, and very considerate.
They know very well what guests would need and give us informations in advance or it's all prepared.

Thank you so much for having us and our family.
We hope we would be lucky enough to stay with you again!!!"
1298200,42699092,2017-04-28T06:35:17Z,非常周到细心的房东 很遗憾因为行程的原因不能再多住一天 谢谢房东的苹果汁 很好喝 房子在安静的住宅区 很适合和家人出行居住哦
1298200,456085,2017-04-27T06:23:18Z,We had an incredible time! The apartment was just what we were looking for and the host were amazing! I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Tokyo! Thanks for everything!
1298200,799527,2017-04-16T23:24:43Z,This is my second time staying at their place. Lovely house and neighbourhood. Amazing hosts. What more can you ask for?
1298200,101459669,2017-04-13T00:56:32Z,"Truly amazing! It felt like staying at a 5 star resort! Amazing home, all the amenities needed, fresh towels each day, and they gave a delicious bottle of Japanese apple juice to my little family (my son loved it.) It was close to everything like stores, restaurants and the train station! Also very friendly;  Mr. T comes by to check up on us if we need help on anything since it was our first time in Japan. And they went out of their way to give us a ride to the main train station when we had all of our luggage at check-out. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect! 

With a lot of love,
-Kyle, Linsie, Gerlin & Tristan  (づ￣ ³￣)づ"
1298200,1501804,2017-04-08T01:03:31Z,"The best AirBNB experience I've ever had. Koji, Nami, and Mr. T go above and beyond to provide you with a warm, personal stay. From the delicious apple juice they hand deliver, to offering rides to Aoto station to make your trip to the airport easier, to unexpectedly providing fresh towels every day, to turning on the lights so when you get home so you're not stumbling in the dark. They truly fit the title of super hosts.

The Pine House is gorgeous and, for Tokyo, very spacious. We loved having breakfast in the upstairs dining and kitchen area - the morning light was so beautiful in that space.

And, while Tateishi is a little farther out than most tourists typically stay, the commutes never felt long and the neighborhood was very lively, with 24/7 restaurants and bars, cute cafes and bakeries, and convenient groceries. If we had more time, we would've liked to explore Tateishi more!

Overall, a superior and amazing stay!"
1298200,92012276,2017-03-31T02:06:20Z,"Calm and comfortable place to stay for 4 people
Very easy to catch the train at 5 minutes walk"
1298200,104345276,2017-03-24T01:56:37Z,We had a great time at this beautiful house.  It felt being at home.
1298200,106871416,2017-03-19T23:05:19Z,"The house is very clean, tidy, well-organised and hosts are very friendly. This is our very first Airbnb booking and it is way beyond what we expected. Universal adaptor, Internet & WiFi, towels, coffee, milk and all the help you need are all there. Tateishi is a nice neighbourhood and a good place to stay, away from the crowded Tokyo central. This stay certainly raise our expectation of airbnb in Tokyo which I'm not sure if other places can meet this. Will come back to this place if we ever come back to Tokyo."
1298200,57822546,2017-03-10T23:44:12Z,"Location is good, easy to find,the house is tidy and clean. Everyday have clean towel for supply. Thanks for the apple juices! Nice place for vacation."
1298200,115035794,2017-03-01T00:58:29Z,Wonderful place with very kind host. Would absolutely recommend! 
1298200,107856241,2017-02-24T01:49:08Z,"总体来说不错,房东热情,每天会过来送浴巾,所有的装修都是新的,有一股松木的味道,整体来说不错,但还是要说如果小孩太小,或者是孕妇的话,因为有比较陡的楼梯,这个是值得考虑的因素,其他都挺好的,也谢谢房东的热情招待。"
1298200,13208665,2017-02-13T02:49:55Z,"Owner is so funny that he made a big note stick at the outer door, even draw a lovely cartoon figure on it who has the same family name with me! :) That made my all family smile at first minute when we saw the house.
The rooms are all warm and lovely with whole wood structure. The firts time I saw it I feel like I'm at home. And, my son really fell in love with it when he got into~~~:)
Besides the gift -- a big bottle of orange juice, Mr. T gave us a lot help, from changing the towers every day to offering the infromation of different tourist spots in Tokyo, till drove us to the closet big train station for our convenience to get on the express line to the airport.
The house is located at north-east corner of Tokyo, 5 minutes to the nearest station by foot, and the neighborhood is really quiet at all the time. So it's good for sleeping at night.
Just be careful when you may change the train at the 押上 stop for going to downtown or back to house, cause some express line don't stop there.
My familly--4 persons spent great 4 nights in the PINE house, it's a good, comfortable and wonderful experience for us with all the help and support from the owners, especially Mr.T, thanks again!"
1298200,69709040,2017-02-08T23:32:38Z,"Very close to keisei-tateshi station. Coild go anywhere in the city conveniently. We had 4 people in our party, and it was great having 2 seperate toilets plus a shower room. Such a clean, nice house. Mr. T was great at bringing by fresh towels, and apple juice in the morning. Would love to stay here again."
1298200,100980206,2017-01-25T23:54:31Z,"Very nice and clean place to stay,not too far from station.The hosts are great and friendly.I will recommend any of my friends to stay here!"
1298200,74560112,2017-01-23T01:03:02Z,So kindly and the house so clean.If we go Japan next tume.We'll still stay here.
1298200,58789123,2017-01-21T00:20:19Z,"위치는 우선 도쿄 중심지에서 조금 떨어져 있지만 지하철로 몇 분만 더 가면 되는 곳으로 위치상 불편한 점은 거의 없었습니다. 무엇보다 가격대비 숙소의 상태가 너무 좋았고, 주인이 참 친절합니다. 주택가에 위치해 있기 때문에 호텔에 묵는 것과는 또다른 새로움을 느낄 수 있었습니다. 만약 도쿄에 다시가게 된다면 또 묵고 싶은 그런 숙소입니다."
1298200,106501655,2017-01-17T02:44:01Z,"房东热情!房子里也提供了详细的周边信息和东京旅游建议,十分实用,附近有个商业街和地铁站,很方便,下次还会考虑入住~"
1245493,124565000,2017-05-08T20:54:09Z,The neighborhood was quiet & very scenic. The guest house had everything we needed from the kitchen to bathroom & even some closet space. We loved Fernando's home & will definitely book again :)
1245493,51311305,2017-04-18T15:04:45Z,"Einfacher und unkomplizierter Zugang zum Apartment, bei Bedarf sofortiger und sehr hilfsbereiter Kontakt des Vermieters, sehr ruhig. Moderne, praktische, schlichte aber sehr funktionale und gute Einrichtung. Gutes Bett."
1245493,88776241,2017-03-28T14:11:19Z,"Nice place, clean, a lot of privacy. Some things need to be replaced/ fixed , like te kitchen table and doors. Fernando responds really quick to any questions you may have. We really appriciate that. Thanks Fernando! "
1245493,35834861,2017-03-25T14:47:12Z,"I really like this house! It's clean and comfortable. Environment here is very good, quiet and natural and many beautiful houses nearby. I love walking around there. But the only shortcoming is there has few store, the nearest CVS is 20 minutes far away by walking and 5 minutes by car. So I have to use uber and uber eats. But I still very enjoy it!"
1245493,119159870,2017-03-19T14:16:41Z,"Cute place, great value."
1245493,120124639,2017-03-16T13:46:45Z,Fernando's place was wonderful. Clean and cozy. Great neighborhood. Will be back!
1245493,8916188,2017-03-07T16:48:38Z,This was our second time staying here. Fernando was easy to communicate with and very responsive. We love the neighborhood and the chance to be close to good shopping and restaurants while also enjoying the quiet neighborhood. 
1245493,5301911,2017-02-26T16:39:47Z,"Fernando and Ana are wonderful. I originally booked a reservation and had to change it last minute. They were very flexible and approved it right away.

Fernando was beyond helpful when I arrived even when I was early for check-in. He is a down to earth and real human being. Such a pleasure having a host like him.

The place was immaculate and so spacious. The whole place is filled with natural light and almost all the lights are on dimmers which sets a new standard for Airbnbs. They also have an Apple TV which was a lifesaver for me traveling for business.

I will be recommending this place to stay for all of my friends, family and contacts who visit Miami.

Love you guys! "
1245493,39392790,2017-02-25T15:44:45Z,Outstanding accommodation.  Super-nice host.  Highly recommended listing
1245493,666044,2017-02-24T15:12:18Z,"We had a wonderful stay at Fernando's. His beautiful apartment is comfortable, cozy and bright. It's located in a quiet neighborhood, yet close to great food and activities in Coral Gables. Fernando was extremely accommodating, especially with our late booking/check-in. We can't wait to stay here again and explore more of Miami!"
1245493,21533437,2017-02-23T14:12:23Z,Fernando's place was great! Right in the center of beautiful Coral Gables neighborhood. Had all that I needed for a quick couple night stay. Communication was great as well. 
1245493,29437305,2017-02-20T16:19:52Z,"This place was super cute and convenient to everything we needed in Coral Gables and close to The Grove. However, it was not very comfortable. The platform bed was super noisy. Any type of slight movement caused loud squeaks and squawks. We didn't sleep well. Also, regular cable wasn't available...only Apple TV. The only channel we could access was CNNgo. Otherwise we couldn't connect/it would stall due to sluggish internet. "
1245493,61279762,2017-02-16T14:46:14Z,"This is a great place that I can only recommend. If you are in Miami looking for a clean, quiet, central, very nicely  decorated apartment in a safe and upscale area look no further. This place has everything you need. Communication with Ana and Fernando was very smooth and they made sure we had everything we needed. We had a great time, thanks for everything!"
1245493,109189459,2017-02-13T14:21:22Z,Everything was great. As expected or better across the board. I would recommend this home to all who find this posting.
1245493,1653474,2017-02-11T17:13:05Z,"This was a great apt to rent for the week - the space was beautiful, the neighborhood was gorgeous, and the hosts were extremely easy to get ahold of. Great experience, and we would highly recommend staying here!"
1245493,2849029,2017-02-07T14:57:13Z,Loved this place! Fernando was an incredible host and great conversationalist! He even printed my boarding pass and had nail polish and remover for my ridiculous request. The studio feels like you're in a resort with all the palm trees beautifully framing the windows. Quick uber ride to UMiami through the gorgeous mansions of Coral Gables. I'll definitely be back!
1245493,75691784,2017-02-05T16:53:18Z,This place is amazing. Would highly recommend. Best deal in Miami. Fernando was beyond helpful. Thank you guys so much!!
1245493,40802723,2017-01-24T14:37:29Z,"This is a very nice apartment in a convenient part of Coral Gables.  The private entrance and lush tropical plants outside make you feel that you have a lot of privacy. A Publix supermarket is close by, as is Little Havana and it is easy to get around the rest of Miami from there. We stayed 6 nights and would go back again!"
1245493,105949714,2017-01-16T13:48:18Z,"Very beautiful, basic place to stay in while travelling. It was a little far from the heart of Miami, but still had many shops and malls around. The area is beautiful and seemed very safe. "
1245493,8234486,2017-01-15T14:44:08Z,"One of the nicest, cleanest, and most comfortable places I've stayed at. You might have to bring your own shampoo, but other than that, really nice place and very responsive guests. "
86456,39482559,2017-05-12T23:52:35Z,"If you want a unique stay in a genuine Treehouse in California, then Dougs Burlingame Treehouse  is for you! 
This very special tree and the family who created the Treehouse around it are great hosts. It was easy enough to find with a GPS, warm, cosy, rustic, and so different! Listening to the gentle creaks and groans of this living Californian Oak tree through your living and sleeping space, along with subdued lighting and candles makes this a very romantic stay for couples. Seperate kitchen area and shower toilet facilities for guests were adequate for our needs. Perhaps a toaster or food warmer would have been helpful, but everything else met our expectations."
86456,38673850,2017-05-08T16:58:09Z,"This treehouse is truly magical. At night the lights around it are great, and the view from the treehouse is awesome. Doug was an fantastic, clear, and helpful host. My wife and I had such an amazing time, and we're so happy for our stay here. 

The creeks in the house were noticeable but for me were a plus. It made it an even more natural ambiance. "
86456,69848272,2017-05-07T17:36:46Z,This place is perfect for escaping the busy silicon valley life. Very cozy and relaxing :]
86456,124330182,2017-05-05T23:06:04Z,My stay in Doug's treehouse was everything I hoped for and more. It was the perfect little getaway complete with movies on the shelf to watch and a cozy nook for reading books. Breakfast in the kitchenette was also amazing! 
86456,68609453,2017-05-04T20:25:53Z,"Just as other reviews said, it's an amazing experience to spend a day in this lovely tree house, every detail in the tree house is impeccable, Doug is so nice, he gave us a bottle of Champagne to celebrate my husband's birthday. We've had a really nice day here. Thank you Doug for sharing your treasure with us. "
86456,63655912,2017-05-02T22:49:46Z,"It is a dream house for everyone, I hope I would build the tree house for all my children! And thanks nice Doug again!"
86456,32929990,2017-05-01T20:41:41Z,Doug and his family were great hosts. They were really considerate and provided everything that we needed. This was my best Airbnb experience ever. 
86456,40835395,2017-04-30T16:24:00Z,Treehouse was a bucket list for us. Glad we finally got to check it off.
86456,89202583,2017-04-29T15:39:47Z,Incredible experience. We spent our three year anniversary there and it added so much to the occasion. Good for special occasions and also for a peaceful night or weekend. Five star experience all around.
86456,30733312,2017-04-18T16:00:23Z,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing time and there was no better place for me to turn 50 than in this beautiful treehouse. Doug helped make my day extra special with care and attention to every detail of our stay. Including leaving a bottle of champagne for my birthday AND accommodating our vegan gluten free diet at the continental breakfast. Please go and experience this magical treehouse, clearly made by Doug and family with love, and so kindly shared with others. "
86456,110875116,2017-04-16T18:04:52Z,"Our stay was amazing. Staying in a tree house was a dream come true! Doug was an amazing host, showed us what we needed and provided us with a nice continental breakfast in the morning. The tree house is filled with different books and notes that describe positivity. This treehouse was amazing romantic getaway. I would highly  recommend this place! "
86456,16622615,2017-04-14T18:34:51Z,The tree house is adorable and our host really thoughtful. The breakfast are delicious and it was magic to stay there for 2 days. We will definitly come back again
86456,16622615,2017-04-13T18:11:02Z,the tree house is adorable and (URL HIDDEN) a must to stay there once in a life time.....the host are really thoughtful and generous.i will stay there again.
86456,121463448,2017-04-12T16:21:47Z,This is an AMAZING place and definitely a once in a life time experience. Doug is wonderful and so is his family. We will definitely be trying to go back in the future. 
86456,15621717,2017-04-09T17:49:18Z,"This was, by far, the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! I came to celebrate my first anniversary with my partner and we had a romantic and unforgettable time. The hosts had excellent attention to detail, the treehouse was adorable and welcoming, and the breakfast was phenomenal! Breakfast consisted of individual parfait cups with mango chunks, blueberries and banana slices, topped with yogurt and dried coconut; delicious pastries; and coffee/orange juice served with a basket to easily carry back to the treehouse if preferred. Doug's daughter, Mackenzie, acted as our host and she was friendly, welcoming and helpful. She spent time with us upon our arrival to answer our questions and help us get settled. She even gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate the occasion! The treehouse is rustic, but my partner and I love nature, so we felt at home with the creaking tree, the spiders living in the corners of the roof, and the walk outside to the bathroom. The morning sunrise is something I will remember forever! There's a reason why this place is booked solid. It's unbelievable."
86456,11341876,2017-04-08T15:40:20Z,This was the second time I have stayed in the treehouse and it was just as lovely as I remembered from our first visit! Doug is an excellent host and thinks of everything to make sure you are comfortable and enjoy your stay. What a unique and wonderful place to spend some quiet time for a night!
86456,118917363,2017-04-05T17:10:10Z,"Simply amazing,  and it'll take your breath away with the view. Truly one of a kind! Book it if it's available!"
86456,25280647,2017-04-03T17:59:51Z,Doug is a great host and very helpful to communicate with. The treehouse is absolutely what I've been looking for. Wonderful experience for a weekend.
86456,14100538,2017-04-02T16:26:20Z,The treehouse is amazing. A lot of beautiful decorations in the house. Wish we could come again.
86456,120730567,2017-04-01T15:45:44Z,"This treehouse is quite a splurge, but it has been the most unique and memorable experiences ever. So if you're hesistant, don't be. You can book a super nice and giant house for the same price, but you won't get a place like Doug's anywhere else. They even provided breakfast for us. The treehouse was really secluded, yet close enough to go out to the city. I would truly recommend this place to anyone looking for an adventure. "
584011,1554517,2017-05-05T06:50:08Z,"Mi Kyung is a treasure, as is her beautiful hanok! If this place is available, book immediately! It will be one of the most amazing experiences of your life. The view, the traditional food and generosity, the peace in the midst of a popular neighborhood... I was able to write and think and meditate here. A treasure!"
584011,64343496,2017-04-24T01:48:15Z,My two daughters and I had a marvellous stay at Mi Kyung's place. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. Mi Kyung is the most wonderful host and cooked us the most delicious traditional breakfast's every morning. We recommend Mi Kyung's hanok to anyone wanting a traditional experience in a excellent location. We can't thank Mi Kyung enough!
584011,3700796,2017-04-17T01:19:51Z,"Great host who cares about her guests. An Hanok in an historical area of Bukchon that offers a quiet relaxing experience and glimpse into the Korean past. Sleep on the heated floor, eat while sitting cross-legged - all an adventure.
Situated between the two major palaces. Metro nearby.
A great listing for the older travellers.
Mi cooks a great breakfast and really cares about you - as you should about her.
"
584011,111677642,2017-04-03T23:34:00Z,"Mikyung's place is in a secluded alley of a highly convenient neighbourhood. Many historical sites and shopping districts are within walking distance, and it takes only ~10 min of pleasant stroll to a subway line that's one transfer from most tourist destinations. I really enjoyed my stay with Mikyung, and will definitely miss the healthy and delicious breakfast!"
584011,60225005,2017-03-23T01:50:41Z,"Our stay with Mi Kyung was absolutely delightful!!! She picked us up from the station, despite us being later than expected (sorry!) and dropped us off on our way to the airport. Every morning she cooked us a korean breakfast, even tailoring it to our specific needs (one of our party is vegan) which was so helpful and kind of her to do ☺️  Her english is amazing so there was no miscommunication, she cleaned our rooms and bathroom every day which was an unexpected surprise and she kept us stocked with tea, coffee, water, chocolate nibbles(!!!) and shower products. She never failed to ask us about how our day had been and what we were going to do, she even packed us a breakfast when she found out we'd be leaving early for a tour to the DMZ which was so sweet of her. Overall, a beautiful home, a lovely host and a lovely area to stay in! Make sure you take the time to fully go around Bukchon, it's gorgeous!
Thanks for a lovely stay!!! ☺️
"
584011,45177190,2016-12-25T23:21:22Z,"这次旅程因为房东我们方便了许多,房东很体贴,每天都会为我们准备最地道的早餐,刚到首尔不认识路她教我们怎么到达最近住所的位置,她在寒风中等我们然后把我们带到住所,房子就在韩屋村,风景很美,让我体验了一次当地风情,交通也很便利,很喜欢这里!"
584011,20516808,2016-12-08T00:29:04Z,"If you want to enjoy real life Seoul you should book this! The best we have ever been and great authentic breakfast.
Never slept on futons before but loved it especially in combination with the floor heating.
All is really clean and neat.
The host Mikyung is so nice! Extremely dedicated to make your stay perfectly!
Location is perfect to go around Seoul, few minutes walk to the subway for exploring the city! This is a super recommendation!
"
584011,62583087,2016-11-18T23:45:45Z,"Thank you, Mi Kyung! The room was lovely, plenty of space, very convenient location, spotlessly clean, and the breakfasts were so delicious! Beautiful home! Hopefully we can stay again in the future!"
584011,3635467,2016-11-13T01:41:18Z,"Mi Kyung is an amazing host! She offered to pick us up at Anguk station on the day we were checking in and even allowed us to check in early! However, as we had lots of heavy luggages, we decided to catch a taxi to her house instead of catching the train. Mi Kyung kindly helped us with our heavy luggages when we got off the taxi. We really appreciated her help! 

Her Hanok was clean and comfortable! It was so well maintained! The rooms and hallway were beautiful! There was even a washing machine that we could use. Mi Kyung cleaned our rooms and toilet everyday. We had to leave early on our first morning as we had to travel to Danyang for paragliding and Mi Kyung was so sweet to pack breakfast for us to have on the car. The korean breakfast that Mi Kyung prepared every morning were delicious! We checked out at 5.30am on our last day and Mi Kyung woke up early to help us with our luggages. She also packed breakfast for us to have on the taxi. She is such a kind and thoughtful host! Zac is a really good dog and we enjoyed his company.

Mi Kyung's Hanok is only a 15 minutes walk to Anguk Station and there are shops along the way. 

We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back again! 

Thanks Mi Kyung! We miss you already!"
584011,15987465,2016-11-05T01:35:44Z,"We loved our stay in Mikyung's hanok!  Her home is beautiful, in a quiet nook near Anguk Station.  We couldn't have picked a better place for our week long stay.  There are great places for sightseeing and eating out nearby, all accessible on foot.  Perfect for our little family with a toddler in tow.  MiKyoung was the most gracious hostess and woke up at the crack of dawn to guide our cab driver to us for pickup to the airport and even packed us a breakfast to go!  We couldn't recommend this cozy home stay more... We'll definitely stay here again the next time in Seoul.  감사합니다 미경씨~"
584011,73480960,2016-10-29T02:11:57Z,Everything was awesome. Enough said!
584011,43198756,2016-10-23T02:26:54Z,"Better than a 5-star hotel! The host was genuinely happy to help me with planing my daily plans. The house is warm, safe and close to the metro station, while the host is super sweet. "
584011,23098323,2016-10-12T05:00:32Z,"Extremely pleasant stay at Mi Kyung's accommodation with awesome breakfast prepared for us each morning. Rooms are clean and beautiful, albeit a little walk uphill to the accom is required. Friendly host who offered to pick us and send us off upon arrival and departure, and who is responsive and quick to answer to any queries raised. Would love to stay at Mi Kyung's accommodation when visiting Seoul again!"
584011,14983571,2016-10-05T23:36:09Z,"We had a wonderful stay at Mi Kyung's. Her Hanok is perfectly located in Bukchon-very touristy but her place itself is very quiet ! Very easy to walk from the Anguk metro and you can walk to the two palaces nearby. Mi Kyung was a lovely host, she welcomed us very well and served us delicious Korean breakfast- everyday a different one !- she even prepared us a snack when we didn't have time for breakfast. The guest rooms and bathroom were very clean, with Hanok-style beds so we got the full Korean experience thanks to her ! Definitely recommend ! :-)"
584011,9316954,2016-10-01T01:57:16Z,"Quel endroit formidable: une maison traditionnelle, avec des paravents, des murs aux matières chaleureuses, avec en prime les petits déjeuners korean style don't on va se souvenir longtemps : nouilles de patates douces, soupe d'algue, poisson grillé... un lieu que l'on recommande les yeux fermés ! L' accueil est à la hauteur du lieu. "
584011,71438328,2016-09-21T06:06:33Z,"Mikyung is a wonderful host and her hanok is a great place to experience Korean traditional house. Comfortable, clean, and feel like home. Easy to get to train station (Anguk) and plenty of nearby attractions such as Changdeok Palace and Gyeongbok Palace. The surrounding neighborhood is quiet, which is very contrast to other places such as Myeongdong and Dongdaemun. Also, don't forget Zec the dog, that always ready for play. 

But mostly, the superstar is the host herself : Mikyung. Very responsive and approachable. She picked us up from nearby bus station on our arrival and cooked us healthy breakfast every morning.

Kamsahamnida, Mikyung. "
584011,26441997,2016-09-10T23:11:02Z,"Incredible! This is a unique bed and breakfast with an owner who takes great pride in her home and your comfort during the stay. I'd highly recommend anyone to stay here without any hesitation. Thank you for your hospitality and your keen attention to detail. 

PS. We will miss you and Jack! "
584011,1483713,2016-07-05T05:14:56Z,"Mi Kyung was so welcoming and accommodating that it seemed like we were visiting friends. In addition to cooking a different breakfast for us every morning, Mi Kyung went out of her way to pack us lunch one of the days we had an early morning tour. The location of the house offers beautiful natural scenery (go for a hike in the hills near her home), and close proximity to shops, metro lines and bus stations. Looking forward to visiting Mi Kyung again soon!"
584011,42819127,2016-06-29T09:02:50Z,"It's really a fantastic live for us that we'll not forget it! Mi kyung is very nice and attentive,let us feel like at home.We can use 1 bedroom,1 sitting room and 1 restroom during our stay.The biggest surprise is the traditional Korean breakfast by Mi kyung' handmade!For that, I can get up on time! The pity is that I didn't talk a lot with Mi kyung because of my poor English &Korean-_-# I'm very proud of my choosing this stay!"
584011,36990347,2016-06-20T00:27:41Z,"This is a great place to stay and our host was wonderful.  The location can't be beat for staying in Seoul. Easy to get everywhere, but quiet. It is far more interesting to stay in a Hanok house than a hotel.  Our hostess made a different, and delicious, Korean breakfast each day of the seven we stayed. She let us do laundry and picked us up at the airport bus stop the day we arrived.  The whole experience was great."
3360785,12583690,2017-03-31T08:38:55Z,"Great apartment in a safe neighborhood. Modern, clean and spacious with a stunning view of the ocean! Anika was a very helpful and considerate host."
3360785,115787416,2017-03-19T07:00:25Z,Anika's place is fantastic; though we only used it as a base so didn't make full use of facilities and areas. Room waw spacious but no view. The surrounding are is quiet and there aren't many bars and restuarants in the immediate vicinity but you are only a very short Uber ride away from these.  Would definately recommend here and will hopefully be back.
3360785,65452688,2017-02-24T07:15:29Z,"We loved our stay at Anika's - she made us feel at home right when we arrived, gave us tips for restaurants and things to do in the area. The house is just as it looks like in the pictures and we used the kitchen and outside area every day which was perfect - especially the views :). The area is great and everything can easily be reached by car, a few supermarkets are close by as well. Parking is available at the street, there's always a free spot available  (our car was broken into, though, which was our fault as we left something in there at night. Anika was very helpful with the police case after it happened!). If you are looking for a central yet quiet place to stay in Cape Town, we would definitely recommend Anika's place!"
3360785,22541001,2017-02-20T08:07:46Z,Beautiful home and location. 
3360785,1323434,2017-02-13T09:38:37Z,Anika's Haus ist erste Wahl für Kapstadt - Lage & Ausstattung top. Wir hatten sehr entspannte Tage hier. Absolut empfehlenswert. 
3360785,31161929,2017-01-24T07:51:10Z,Anika's place is amazing. Luxury at a great price and fabulous location and amenities. We would definitely be back here again. We have to cook a lot because of food intolerances and her kitchen is amazing! We felt safe and at home here just a pity we have to leave now for a cold UK!
3360785,75790431,2017-01-17T07:14:25Z,"Wir hatten 4 Nächte bei Anika, das Haus liegt sehr zentral und ist sehr geräumig. Der Pool durfte genutzt werden, das Bett ist bequem und jedes Zimmer hat ein eigenes geräumiges Fach im Kühlschrank. Wir haben Anika nur kurz getroffen, sie war sehr sympathisch und hilfsbereit. Gerne wieder! "
3360785,6463798,2017-01-13T08:47:02Z,"Anika is an amazing host, super accommodating, together with her husband, who is very kind as well and responsive at all times. Enjoyed my stay to the fullest, the view is amazing, all rooms are spacious, cosy and clean. Garden and pool side is perfect. Totally recommend Anika's flat :) "
3360785,44163085,2017-01-09T08:46:15Z,"Wir waren 5-Tage bei Anika und haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen. Die Villa bietet tolle Möglichkeiten, wie zum Beispiel die gut ausgestattete Küche und den attraktiven Gartenbereich mit Pool! Die Lage der Unterkunft in Seapoint ist ruhig und trotzdem stadtnahe. Ein Uber an die Waterfront kostet 36,00Rand. 
Bei unserem nächsten Besuch in Kapstadt würden wir gerne wieder hier nächtigen. Absolut empfehlenswert!"
3360785,2115522,2016-12-26T08:16:16Z,"Wir hatten eine großartige Zeit in Anikas Haus in Sea Point mit Blick auf den Ozean. Es erinnert an ein Guest House, nur eben mit der Möglichkeit sich selber zu versorgen. Die Küche ist wunderbar ausgestattet. Unsere Mitbewohner waren klasse, wir hatten tolle Abende auf der Couch im Wohnzimmer oder draußen auf der Terrasse. Das Zimmer (Room A) war sauber und ordentlich. Wir haben richtig wohlgefühlt und kommen gerne wieder."
3360785,17356691,2016-12-21T09:58:20Z,Great accommodation in a prime location!
3360785,31421944,2016-12-06T09:09:02Z,"Great Place - Great Host - Great stay. 
I recommend this place "
3360785,71175497,2016-11-02T07:14:09Z,Anika's house was even better than the description suggests. Great location to get to know Capetown. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended. 
3360785,3451033,2016-10-30T06:24:03Z,"Anika's place is the perfect for a Cape Town stay. Everything from location, communication, facilities and cleanliness to view is top notch. Also, you can go for a run and workout at the outdoor gym just a couple of minutes away on the waterfront. We did not meet Anika in person but her friends Brigid and Adam took care of everything. I doubt you can find better value for money anywhere in Cape Town. We'd definitely stay at Anika's again."
3360785,79564861,2016-10-17T06:10:47Z,"Anika foi ótima, receptiva e nos deixou a vontade no seu espaço. "
3360785,98961451,2016-10-10T15:48:24Z,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3360785,56799426,2016-10-07T07:57:23Z,"Wir waren für 5 Tage bei Anika zu Besuch. Vielen lieben Dank für die unkomplizierte, komfortable und mega freundliche Unterbringung liebe Anika! Ihr habt eine klasse Aussicht, man fühlt sich bei Euch direkt zuhaus, hat Zeit für sich, kann aber auch alles nutzen, was man braucht. In dem bequemen Bett haben wir sehr gut geschlafen, es blieben einfach keine Wünsche offen. Herzliche Grüße und alles Liebe für die Zukunft!"
3360785,74608037,2016-10-01T09:07:12Z,"Well beforehand, Anika was in contact with me to make sure everything was in place and that she would be there to meet us on our arrival. Very friendly and helpful host and had everything in order. The place has a very modern feel and very spacious in all rooms. Dimming lights right through, plenty of cupboard space, everything was clean and neat all the time. Dedicated labeled shelf space in the fridge downstairs. A place I would highly recommend to anyone and gladly go back to. 

I've stayed in other accommodations before and paid more and there were lots of little things wrong which made it annoying to stay there. This place has NONE of those downfalls. Have never stayed so comfortably anywhere before.

The location is also perfect. Easy access to city center and the whole seapoint along High Road which is much quieter than Main Road. You can also see the para gliders flying overhead who launch from signal hill right behind you."
3360785,460129,2016-09-13T07:23:22Z,Beautiful house in a nice neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay.
3360785,75115640,2016-09-03T05:13:06Z,Anika was a great host and her house is beautiful!
7377405,10061110,2017-05-04T11:26:24Z,Great apt.  Perfect location.  Quick and easy drive from airport and 1 1/2 blocks from beach. Convenient to restaurants and shops.
7377405,45313654,2017-04-25T12:16:11Z,"Marc's spot is amazing! Very centrally located in Sea Point, very close to shops and restaurants with a wonderful view of Table Mountain. We requested to book very last minute and Marc responded immediately and had the place ready when we got there. I would definately recommend Marc's spot, its perfect. "
7377405,77815401,2017-04-19T06:38:51Z,A nice cosy place close to various amenities one might need. Marc is very helpful and was always available to help. 
7377405,31863242,2017-04-13T07:15:17Z,Great apartment close to all amenities.  Would definitely go back.
7377405,29724211,2017-04-11T06:36:31Z,We had a fantastic time staying in this apartment. The apartment was beautiful. Great location and we felt very safe here. Marc was an excellent host. We would love to stay here again. 
7377405,8063287,2017-04-05T09:07:13Z,"Great apartment in a perfect location. The neighborhood is very pleasant and there are many shops and good restaurants a few meters from the apartment. It's very close both to the city center (10 min drive) and to the beautiful sea front for nice walks or runs. The apartment itself is spacious and clean and corresponds to the description. You'll find all the necessary equipment for selfcatering and daily needs. Marc is very helpful and can be easily reached. 100% recommended. 
"
7377405,101490127,2017-03-30T07:08:50Z,"Marc's place ticked all the boxes: ideal central location five minutes from the Waterfront; good local amenities and excellent restaurants (Posticcino's for Pizza- oh my!); excellent security; plenty of space and a quirky interior that was way more pleasant than just another bland hotel room. Marc has been lightning fast in replying to every little question, and check in and out was a dream. A lovely guy with a great place- you really can't go wrong."
7377405,11305615,2017-03-21T08:50:52Z,The perfect airbnb. Enough said. 
7377405,43520424,2017-03-19T07:45:55Z,"Marc's place was exactly as the website advertised and all communication and check ins and outs were seamless. 

Will be back "
7377405,11961679,2017-03-17T06:09:49Z,"I couldn't recommend Marc any higher. His flat is impeccable, location is great, quiet and near everything you want to be near and to top it off he's a great host!"
7377405,79668567,2017-03-14T08:54:36Z,"Marc's home was amazing , just the right size with everything in it. A walk from the gorgeous beach corniche and with all the shops downstairs right on our doorstep, not too far from anywhere , we loved Marc's home which was very well decorated and with an eclectic style which we loved , we will definitely be back. Marc was a great host ! "
7377405,14644258,2017-03-09T07:39:12Z,"Very cozy appartment in the heart of Seapoint. Lovely details make you feel like home. Also very safe appartment complex with private parking. Everything you need (supermarket, coffee, restaurant, breakfast) is just around the corner or in the piazza.
Marc was a wonderful host, he gave us nice recommendations and responded always quickly.  Perfect stay!"
7377405,4076693,2017-02-27T06:09:20Z,"Great stay. Super-convenient, super-helpful hosts. Everything on the doorstep. Kids loved it, too. Great"
7377405,107088911,2017-02-25T09:10:42Z,"Marc's place was just as amazing as the photos depicted. From the view to the spacious layout to the decor, it was a great place to stay. My best friend and I made a long road trip from the western cape to the eastern cape and back again, ending here for two nights and it was in a great location to end our trip. We were in walking distance to the beach so we caught an amazing sunset, and we enjoyed a long walk from his place to the V&A waterfront in the am. Then we drove from his place to Hout Bay and visited the bay harbor market per his recommendation, which we loved. His girlfriend, Laura, was kindly waiting for us to get there and they were both very understanding when we were late on our arrival due to terrible traffic coming into CT. They we're very helpful and communicative the entire time. Laura even checked to make sure I didn't leave something behind after we checked out. I hope to return to Cape Town again and would definitely stay here if available. "
7377405,6754068,2017-02-23T07:41:01Z,"Perfect location, Marc is a great host! We had a wonderful time!"
7377405,70807670,2017-02-13T09:59:30Z,This place ticked all the boxes..  you can't fault it. Five star..
7377405,53677532,2017-02-12T08:25:59Z,"My wife and I had a wonderful time at Marc's place. It is very nice and an easy walk to restaurants, shops, and the Ocean. The view from the balcony of Table Mountain and Lion's Head was better than expected! Marc was very quick to respond and very helpful with his advice! Would love to visit here again!"
7377405,10027599,2017-02-08T09:40:23Z,"Very good communication; you get a stunning view over signal hill and lions head (no need to be on the sea side!); apartment feels bigger as on the images shown; very secure property (but mind the small step to the elevators :-) )

we would book again if we're in cape town again!"
7377405,1895298,2017-02-04T07:46:14Z,Marc's place is great! 
7377405,107041284,2017-02-01T09:36:05Z,"Everything was perfect. I really appreciated the added touches of a full supply of basic toiletries, coffee, tea, milk in the fridge, and the bottle of wine (which I didn't even open, but nice touch anyway). Also, the aircon was great on the few days I used it.
Marc is super accommodating and efficient with both check-in and check-out times.
I would definitely stay there again when I return to Cape Town. Highly recommended."

Merci"
595936,111372241,2017-05-08T08:19:45Z,"J'ai bien aimé l'emplacement à la fois calme et proche des commerces ainsi que le coté typique de la maison. Elle est très bien équipée à l'intérieur (lave-vaisselle, lave-linge, etc...) comme à l'extérieur (table jardin, lafuma pour se détendre)."
595936,11205395,2017-04-06T09:04:37Z,"La Trinite-sur-Mer is a nice little town with a large Marina located ideally to discover Southern Bretagne or spend some with walking / on a small beach. And the appartement is located ideally  close to the center of it..

It offers everything which is needed, the communication and check-in went perfectly and the decoration is nice, too.

In summary: it could hardly been better and we had a perfect time."
595936,55928540,2016-10-30T08:42:16Z,"très bon accueil, la maison est bien aménagée et à proximité du port et commerces. Nous avons passé un weekend très sympa.
"

Il y a vraiment tout le nécessaire dans cette petite maison pour vivre très confortablement. Nous y retournerions avec plaisir.
Et la région est tellement belle!!!!
Merci pour toutes les petites attentions "
595936,51446732,2016-10-11T00:43:12Z,Wonderful spot with all the amenities. Josiane was an excellent hostess and provided great recommendations and maps to the area. 
595936,57506339,2016-10-09T00:59:57Z,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Josiane hat Adressen bereit gelegt mit Informationen über gute Restaurants. Zahlreiche Hefte, Bücher und Prospekte machten auf Aktivitäten und Attraktionen in der Umgebung aufmerksam.
Das Haus ist sehr gut eingerichtet. Es ist alles vorhanden, was Frau braucht."
595936,63714140,2016-09-26T02:30:10Z,"Un séjour très agréable, bien situé et un accueil personnalisé qui nous a beaucoup touché. Une petite maison décorée avec goût. Que du bonheur."
595936,65947170,2016-09-05T06:50:31Z,"Nous avons passé trois jours et deux nuits entre amis à la trinité sur mer. Josiane nous a réservé un bon accueil, nous nous sommes tout de suite sentis bien dans cette maison.
 Elle a eu la délicatesse et la gentillesse de nous installer du matériel pour enfant dans la maison, ce qui nous a éviter de nous encombrer pour le trajet en voiture.
La maison est très confortable et cosy! 
Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans cette charmante petite maison et nous la recommandons vivement à d'autres voyageurs! 
Merci Josiane! "
595936,56151864,2016-08-28T00:35:05Z,"Nous avons séjourné fin août dans la maison de Josiane. La maison a beaucoup de charme et l'intérieur est très bien équipée. Le port et les commerces sont accessibles en 5 min à pied, pour la plage mieux vaut privilégier la voiture. A savoir : la maison se trouve le long d'une route fréquentée donc un peu bruyante."
595936,51840781,2016-08-21T02:06:53Z,"Cette petite maison est charmante, la décoration est très agréable. L'accès au port à pied est facile. Notre hôte a été très sympathique et arrangeante (ex : stationnement). Les photos correspondent tout à fait à la réalité. Un seul point serait néanmoins à préciser concernant cette location. Habitant en appartement tout au long de l'année, nous avons loué cette maison en pensant bénéficier d'un extérieur indépendant. En réalité, la terrasse de la propriétaire donne sur la terrasse de la location. L'espace entre les 2 maisons est très réduit. Bien que notre hôte ait été très discrète, nous n'avons pas profité pleinement de l'espace extérieur."
595936,13930115,2016-08-14T02:12:26Z,"Notre séjour fut en adéquation totale avec ce que nous pensons être l'esprit Airbnb : maison familiale charmante, hôtesse discrète et disponible, emplacement idéal pour séjourner à la Trinité/Mer, parfait, donc."
595936,10369766,2016-07-31T02:20:04Z,"Agréable séjour dans une maison coquette et fonctionnelle, à deux pas du port, mais au calme. Excellent point de départ pour raillonner alentours. Ne pas hésiter à louer."
595936,17630624,2016-07-23T00:13:07Z,The house is conveniently located. The communication with Josiane was very easy and she is a great host. The overall condition of the location is great and the house is very well equipped. We would definitely stay there again. 
595936,77448570,2016-07-18T09:55:30Z,"Hormis un micro-ondes absent, tout est parfait dans cette petite maison, de sa propriétaire d'une gentillesse et d'une serviabilité extrême, à l'intérieur, en passant par l'extérieur. En plus la maison est bien abritée et exposée pleins sud. Pas besoin de voiture pour se balader, le port et les commerces à 2 mn à pied. N'ayez aucune hésitation à vous rendre. Comme nous, vous serez forcément sous le charme."
595936,24658329,2016-07-13T06:13:21Z,"Notre séjour chez Josiane a été à la hauteur de nos attentes. Notre hôte nous a accueilli chaleureusement et est restée disponible durant notre petit séjour. L'appartement correspond exactement à la description et est très agréable. Il est très bien placé à la Trinité : à la fois proche de toutes les commodités mais aussi situé dans une rue calme donc il n'y a pas de nuisances sonores. 
Je recommande vivement ce logement ! Merci pour votre accueil Josiane."
595936,53743014,2016-07-10T02:08:13Z,Our family of four had a wonderful stay in this cottage!  Josianne was an extremely helpful host.  The cottage was equipped well and a charming place to stay.  It is within easy walking distance to the harbor and shops and a short drive from some spectacular beaches.  We hope to return to Brittany and would definitely stay here again.
595936,11266732,2016-07-04T03:35:55Z,Josiane was there to meet myself and my husband.  She showed us around the house and gave us details of restaurants and the wifi.  The house is lovely.  Nice little patio to sit in the sun.  Very well equipped and clean.  It was easy to walk to the lovely restaurants in La Trinite Sur Mer.  We particularly like Le Surcouf which has a great menu du jour for 20 euros.  There is a market on Fridays which we were able to attend which is excellent.  Easy drive to lovely beaches.  Only thing that was not good was the weather but we still had an amazing time and would love to stay again.  Thank you Josiane for allowing us to stay in your lovely home.
595936,36963662,2016-06-20T00:14:47Z,"Ravissante maison situé au calme et non loin du port. La maison est parfaitement propre et L'accueil de Josiane a été très sympathique et la maison est bien équipée, impeccable et très confortable. Nous y reviendrons avec grand plaisir."
595936,53472148,2016-06-10T10:18:44Z,"We had a lovely stay, we were welcomed and shown around on our arrival, the cottage was clean and well equipped.The position of the cottage was perfect for access to the quayside but was also peaceful and quiet. We certainly hope to return."
84236,9029017,2017-05-01T05:52:18Z,"Nous avons séjourné en famille pendant 5 jours dans ce lieu magique ! Les enfants avaient de quoi s'occuper avec les terrains de sport, la piscine et le jacuzzi pendant que les parents admiraient le spectaculaire paysage. Nous avons passé un meilleur moment, merci Chryssa!!!!"
84236,28284701,2017-04-16T08:35:25Z,"Delenia is a very special place. A dream hanging on an edge of a cliff. We had a great time there, adults and kids. We loved the meals Maria cooked for us and appreciated the good attitiude of Nadia and Jovani, the caretakers of the place. We loved everything about the place and the surroundings. Thank you very much, Chryssa!"
84236,38158841,2017-03-12T09:52:25Z,"Chryssa's villa is just amazing, like in a fairy tale! The place is in the middle of mother nature, by magical surroundings! Everyone hosting us were very helpful, friendly and kind people. The home made traditional food was excellent. We recommend to all, who enjoy a private, calm place, with great adventures to try. An exclusive, traditional, and hand made lovely home full of spirit! For families and friends :))"
84236,15501603,2016-10-20T01:03:56Z,"We used the villa for our mothers 70th birthday party and a surprise marriage celebration. 

We were 10 adults and 11 children aged 17-1. 

The space is great  for large groups and families, although not 5 star, it had great flexible rooms that work for a variety of family sizes.  The rooms are creative and fun with bunked beds for kids and even a rope swing.  

The staff is very laid back and friendly Although the facilities may not be 5 stars the views definitely are. 

The staff happily helped us with the (broken) hot tub and made it work for the kids in the morning and afternoon and was hot enough for the adults at night. 

The kitchen is well equipped and there is a giant dining room table that fit all of us both inside and outside. The outside table overlooks the water. The cooks were very sweet and overall we were very pleased with the meals and food. 

We loved and used the outdoor brick oven as well as all the outdoor sitting spaces, pool and basketball/ tennis court. 

The villa is located down a steep cliff so a 4 wheel drive vehicle is a good idea although we managed without. 

It also made for beautiful a challenging morning runs. 

We would recommend this spot.  Our mother said it was one of the best weeks of her life. 
"
84236,9087187,2016-09-25T02:43:35Z,"We found Delenia on a list of 'Top 10 Airbnb's for a Wedding' and it was exactly what my son and his fiancee were looking for. We visited Evia from the UK in May to make arrangements and were fortunate to be able to visit Delenia, Chryssa the host was very helpful in this regard. Our first view of this unique gem was a 'catch your breath moment' and as soon as we began to explore we knew it would be perfect. We returned last week for a 6 day stay with the wedding party of 13 and Delenia lived up to and exceeded our expectations.

We were two families, one English, one Lithuanian and we came together in this magical place for a simply wonderful wedding.

The staff are unfailingly helpful. Maria and Coulla cooked us a delicious meal every evening at a very reasonable cost and also provided our traditional Greek wedding feast. The food was undoubtedly one of the highlights of stay.

The local florist and patisserie in Nea Styra (local ferry port) supplied the flowers and wedding cake. The celebrant (who conducted the wedding in English and Russian), photographer and hair/make-up artist came across from Athens. Whilst these details are strictly outside the scope of this review, they were nevertheless things we struggled to find initially and feel that others planning a Delenia wedding might find such information useful. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Cherryshots to contact us.

We liked the staff and believe they liked us too, the staff speak Greek and Russian, I don't, but my new Lithuanian daughter in law does so that was fine! Jovanni the caretaker and his wife Nadia were, like the chefs, smiley and keen to please and that made for a stay which we will all remember.

Chryssa was quick to respond to me, and whilst we haven't met, I feel she is a gifted person who is keen to see her father's legacy survive, and so it should.

I will always remember this trip and hope I can return.

Have no doubt, visit!"
84236,24884693,2016-09-11T01:45:28Z,"We stayed at the villa with 15 people of us for the wedding. There were plenty of room for all of us. We enjoyed Maria's food--however, please make sure you know the cost of the meals and its service before agreeing to them. We highly recommend the stuffed peppers--so GOOD! Joavani was wonderful and was mostly there when we needed him. If you want to do the laundry, give the laundry to the maid in advance and there is no dryer. This place is not best accessible for senior citizens. We swam in the sea and explored the area near the villa. Beautiful! Thank you Chryssa for sharing your lovely place with us.  "
84236,19377981,2016-08-02T01:07:01Z,"We were a group of 21 guests who came to Villa Decennia for our wedding and stayed for 3 days. This is truly a very special place as so much thought was put into the place. Even just finding the right location took many years, but Chryssa's father (the man who built the entire place) put so much detail into the place and decorated it with all different kinds of furniture, artwork and other pieces from all his travel. 

The team who works there really helps to make every guest have a wonderful time. Eleni, was there on sight to answer any questions we may have and help us with any requests. Maria and her team, made us the wedding rehearsal dinner and a few other meals during our stay which was probably the best Greek food we had the entire trip! Try the loukamades (Greek doughnut) which is the best dessert!

We feel we couldn't have picked a better place for our wedding and were so glad that we were able to have our closest family and friends come to this place to celebrate with us. Our only complaint was that our stay was too short and next time we will be sure to book for at least a week! "
84236,5665883,2016-07-21T01:30:36Z,"Though the road to Delenia is not easy, I assure you that every step to get there is worth the effort. As soon as we arrived we felt  transported to a truly magical place. Spotty internet and cell service were a blessing in disguise, as it only helped us to focus on each other and the unparalleled beauty of the location. 

We swam in the crystal Aegean water below, dared to dive off it’s rocks and explore it’s caves. This spirit of discovery just began at the water. Every nook and cranny of the villa told a story from the hand-made woodwork, unique decorations and even all of the animals that roamed the property. That being said, there was more than enough to explore at the villa for 6 days. However, we did venture out 1 day to do a snorkeling trip around the Petali islands with Dikelas dive center, which was great fun!

One of the highlights of Delenia is undoubtably the people who help to keep it running. Chryssa and the staff went above and beyond to care for our every need.  

We had a lovely, intimate wedding ceremony with about 30 guests just before sunset and the backdrop could not have been more breathtaking. Maria (Delenia's cook) made us her incredible wedding feast and we danced away the rest of the night. The staff, cooks and their husbands also helped us to celebrate with some Greek music, dancing and spirits. 

Though a bit rustic and off the beaten path, Delenia is one of the most unique and beautiful places that we have ever been. If you make the journey I promise that you will have a memory to keep for a lifetime. "
84236,4099696,2016-07-15T02:08:53Z,"La casa è situata in una parte incontaminata dell'isola , lontana da tutto . La vista è' spettacolare !!! La villa però necessità di tanta manutenzione , ci sono tante cose da sistemare , ma quest'aria  decadente la rende incredibilmente  affascinante . Consigliata  x gli amanti della natura e del relax . 
Heleni e suo marito sono stati gentilissimi , le cuoche eccellenti !"
84236,2329884,2016-07-02T03:12:39Z,"Villa Delenia is, amazingly, just as magical as all the reviews state. It's remote, rugged, and unbelievably beautiful. We held our wedding there with 35 guests and couldn't have picked a better place. We lounged, sunbathed, hiked, scrambled on rocks, and kayaked happily. The food was also a highlight - the cooks who work at the house are wonderful and very accommodating to whatever needs a group might have.

Overall, it's hard to imagine regretting a trip to Villa Delenia.

 "
84236,24454763,2016-06-27T00:59:15Z,"Sensational holidays, the villa is exactly as seen on the pictures. It was a beautiful stay and all our guests were very happy. The staff is very friendly and the cooking was.... delicious! It is important that you stricly follow the GPS coordinates instead of using street or village names. I recommend to go by rental car. It is simple 2,5 hours ride from Athen airport. Public transportation is rather difficult and only few people speak English in Greece."
84236,29207788,2016-06-13T00:26:27Z,"My family and I spent a week at this beautiful property and we enjoyed it a lot. 7 adults and 4 kids. Absolutely stunning views and a sunrise to die for! The houses and rooms are slightly dated but that is balanced by the kind and great housekeeper Eleni, as well as the two cooks we had preparing all our lunches  and dinners. "
84236,11394564,2016-06-05T03:32:12Z,"Where do start? Before arrival Chryssa helped answer out infinite amount of questions. Soooo helpful and knowledgeable. Chryssa's villa is a complete dream. We traveled from Los Angeles with our closest family and friends to get married here at the villa. The villa is very old world and eccentric. And the person who holds it all together is Eleni. She helped arrange all the complicated travel for our friends and family. And helped us find a cake and flowers for the wedding. We could have had a more wonderful wedding and vacation. This beautiful villa is definitely remote and cell service can get difficult. Make sure you understand that you will be relaxing at the villa. There if course are bugs and insects, but understandably. So if you are looking for modern very hotel like accommodations this isn't for you. But if you want traditional Greek food, a beautiful night sky, and beautiful memories with friends and family, book asap.  :)  "
84236,3842325,2016-05-10T00:55:08Z,"It's hard to express how special Villa Delenia is, and even harder to say something that hasn't already been said about it. 

You couldn't dream up a place that has so much to offer a group of 15 friends, in a wonderfully isolated escape from the world. We have recommended Delenia to everyone we know, which I now somewhat regret as it is likely to be booked up 5 years in advance and we are wanting to go back for every birthday, wedding and christening until we're 80.

We snorkelled for Urchins, kayaked around bays, discovered a cave full of bats, fished (unsuccessfully), danced a Greek dance (semi - successfully), devoured a Greek wedding feast, played chess whilst gazing at the sea, went for a walk with a tortoise, hugged a wind turbine, stargazed from the hot tub, played tennis as the sunset, went swimming as the sun rose and spent hours of uninterrupted time, sharing stories and moments with our wonderful friends.  We will take away so many memories.

Chryssa was amazing, helping to arrange transfers and replying to all of my questions quickly.

The food was outstanding and is a beautiful taste of local, home cooked Greek cuisine. Maria and her team were fantastic and each meal was more extravagant than the last.

Eleni and Vasseli were the perfect hosts. Nothing was too much trouble and they made the place feel like home. They are such warm, friendly people and they are essential to making Delenia so special. 

It would be good to mention that we didn't hire cars and we still had a perfect time. If you like a really good hike you can get to the beach by foot but I wouldn't fancy doing it in July, in the heat. If you want to go and visit anywhere else you will need a car but Vasseli was more than happy to drive a few of us to the port for a couple of food/booze runs. No one in our group of friends was remotely interested in going anywhere else. 

Thank you, to you all! We will be back! "
84236,34911558,2016-05-04T00:39:17Z,"We spent 4 unforgettable days at the villa Delenia and we will never forget this time. It was filled with calmness and amazing beauty of this place, precious moments of family & friends gathering together at the edge of the world. We had friendly & warm welcome from Elenia, Maria and all the team, who constantly supported us in all regards - food, transfers, and any questions we had related to villa itself, any time of the day and night. They managed to become the part of the family for this short period of time, and I already miss them dearly. 
As a tip for future travellers, it's better to arrange your transfers as a one group, not separate dedicated ones, and adjust it to ferry's schedule. But once you achieved your destination point of Villa Delenia, you can leave all your troubles behind and enjoy the unity with the universe - breathtaking sea view, fresh air,  joy of dropping your friend in the swimming pool ;), walks along the seaside, amazing food cooked by Maria & team, evenings in front of the sea with those whom you love. There were 16 of us in total - 12 of family and friends and 4 of the team, and we were comfortably situated at the Villa & Barn Conversion. 
Every day was quite special for us as there are so many nice things about Delenia. Our parents learned big tennis, our friends conquered May sea, other part of them enjoyed wine and food - probably the best thing about Delenia is that everyone can choose what he/she likes. And I can't forget to mention all these pretty corners which make your wedding photo session a dream one. 
It was a fest of joy and happiness - and I'm so grateful to Chryssa, Elenia, Maria and all the people who made this happen. Thank you guys - and keep being same bright souls as you are. "
84236,1156924,2016-04-11T18:45:07Z,"I kept villa Delenia in my wish list for a long time, before I finally had the opportunity to gather my family and friends in this ""paradise on earth"".

The place is truly amazing, the views are breathtaking, the smell of the blossom makes you wanna sing, the food prepared by a diligent local cooks is really authentic and tasted like a great homemade meal. 

Rooms are spacious, each with its own character, very comfortable beds. I also liked the shampoos and soaps provided by Chryssa's team.

If you plan to visit Delenia, renting a car according to host's recommendation is a MUST. The road within the village is steep and partly unpaved, which bust the adrenaline, but can be quite challenging and with a big car like ours, takes some 45 minutes one way. The view is absolutely stunning and we even came across a huge turtle on the side of the road.

Local cats made us feel like home and it was great having an option to dine inside or outside the house, depending on the weather. 

Chryssa was very prompt replying my emails and it is was easy to coordinate everything with her team. 

We had a short, but really great holiday, thank you Chryssa and team! 
"
84236,7917327,2015-12-13T11:12:03Z,"Chryssa is a fabulous host , she organized everything perfectly for my 30st birthday!

We loved our stay at Delenia, the villa is amazing so is the cooking!
Two days was too short, we didn't want to go back!
I highly recommend this place and would love to go back there during the summer….for a bit longer though !

Thank you Chryssa and Delenia's staff!

84236,17018553,2015-10-24T12:43:02Z,My wife and I got married at Delenia a few days ago and I must say pictures don't do it justice. The villa and all its surroundings are more than beautiful and the rooms are each so unique and charming its amazing. Chryssa was so helpful with all our questions and with arranging our transfers from Athens. My family enjoyed it so much there we are planning another trip back next year. I can't say enough how beautiful it is there and how amazing this villa is. We will be back soon thanks!
84236,20856983,2015-10-01T11:15:07Z,"Delenia is almost exactly as described on-line and detailed in Chryssa's introductory letter. The road is a little more frightening… Do not expect a luxurious establishment but a warm, rustic accommodation. You do not feel like leaving the place at all. You have everything you need at hand: swimming (pool and/or sea), tennis, basketball, hiking, sunbathing, indoor activities, cooking, wining and dining… The place fits all sizes. Our ""tribe"" of 18 ranged ages from 5 to 80 to the enjoyment of all. Highly recommended for family gathering and integration"
84236,10963187,2015-09-24T11:35:05Z,"
Delenia is a fantastic resort for a group of up to 10 people.
There is an awsome creative athmosphere for work and recreation.
The sauna, the pool, the jacuzzi, the tennis court, the area for promenades – all together, there 
Is a garantee for never getting bored. 
You are really transported to the end of the world on roads that local taxis do not appreciate. 
But the caretaker Giovanni and his Nadja are really doing a fantastic job. The same thing goes for Maria and the
Crowd around her, cooking one of the hot meals a day – lunch or supper (you choose).
Chryssa has invented a very special concept. She is woring in a creative profession herself.  Her place in Greece
Is perfect for groups from creative professions gathering strength och inspiration.
We stayed in Delenia during the worst thunderstorm that the island has had since 1938.
A lovely adventure. Thanks. "

The view is amazing as is the location.
We are coming back to Lisbon and this is where will definitely stay again.  Many thanks :-)"
2025705,126647855,2017-05-01T12:55:36Z,"Nuestra estancia fue corta pero la casa es muy bonita y cómoda, las vistas impresionantes! Está equipada con todo lo necesario. Argentina nos puso facilidades para dejar las maletas antes de tiempo. Esperamos volver!"
2025705,101637604,2017-04-30T09:43:01Z,"Petit appart impeccable situé tout au haut du Sitio. La plus belle vue que vous pouvez imaginer. Tout est bien équipé, tout près du funiculaire qui vous descend dans la basse ville. Argentina est super adorable, et son fils communique très rapidement. Le restaurant en bas de l'appart est super bon et super silencieux. J'y retournerai un jour..."
2025705,34279264,2017-04-28T07:07:27Z,"Amazing place. You don't need a TV, only look at the window!!!! 
Apartment is comfortable, clean and well equipped. We had everything we need and even more (oil, tea, coffee...). Thanks for perfect vacation."
2025705,8010093,2017-04-26T14:47:55Z,"Appartement conforme au attente , Argentina et sont fils sont très gentille et disponible , je recommande cette appartement ! Et la vue et à couper le souffle ont à une vue plongeante sur tout nazaré !"
2025705,108687160,2017-04-25T09:36:22Z,Wat een uitzicht. Prima appartement. Leuk plaatsje. Om de hoek zit de lift naar de benedenstad. Op loopafstand de bovenstad. Lekker eten bij de bar beneden. Maar daardoor ook wat lawaai vanuit de bar want het appartement is er recht boven. In onze periode sloot de bar rond 8 uur s avonds maar in het hoogseizoen zal dat anders zijn. 
2025705,40778209,2017-04-19T08:41:01Z,"Joli appartement très bien situé a proximité des commidités et avec une vue imprenable sur Nazaré et sa plage. Situé au dessus d'un bar mais qui n'est pas bruyant. Appartement propre, bien équipé, salle de bain et chambre exigues mais suffisant pour une nuit. Dommage que nous n'aillons pas été accueillis par Argentina mais communication efficace avec son fils Marco."
2025705,31066041,2017-04-17T07:23:20Z,Vue juste exceptionnelle ! Petit studio bien amenagé. Situé juste au-dessus d'un bar / resraurant mais qui ferme assez tot et ouvre assez tard donc pas de bruit pendant la nuit.
2025705,55824724,2017-04-12T09:24:17Z,Hard to beat the view! The place was clean and we had everything we needed. It was nice to be able to make breakfast in the morning! There is a bar downstairs but they were closed the first night and were quiet the second night. 
2025705,59111758,2017-04-08T09:26:16Z,"Argentina's apartment must have the best view in Nazare. It is compact, but fully equipped and very comfortable. As hosts Argentina and her family are superb and extremely helpful, a real credit to Airbnb.
We loved our time in Nazare. Breakfast on the lovely sunny balcony is a must!
We can't find fault with the apartment. It was spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds and loads of towels. The previous guests had left a few beers in the fridge (as did we). The kitchen was sufficiently well equipped to rustle up simple meals. There is a small supermarket about 200m away and several restaurants nearby. 
I would recommend a trip on the ascensor as the walk up from the town back up the hill is a hard climb in the heat. The tickets are cheap. We bought a weekly ticket for about €8. 
Overall a wonderful apartment, with stunning views, in a beautiful part of Portugal. "
2025705,23250289,2017-04-02T10:02:18Z,"A casa é muito boa para uma estadia curta, a vista é fantástica e correu tudo muito bem.
De notar que a casa é por cima de uma taverna o que é um pouco incómodo de noite, apesar de fechar relativamente cedo."
2025705,60603272,2017-03-23T10:25:18Z,"I had 5 really nice days in Argentinas apartment. It felt like being on top of the world with the spectacular view over the town,  beach and towards the horizon.
I enjoyed long walks on the beaches and the surrounding area, fun to see all the people in town in the weekend and the more quiet citylife the rest of the week. 
Argentina is very sweet and welcoming, her son helped with english communication. 
Highly recommended! 

"
2025705,5878768,2017-03-18T08:08:23Z,"The apartment has one of the best views in Nazare! The apartment was clean and with all the equipment needed. If you want a romantic and unique place, this apartment is the right place to go! We loved our stay and wish to come back one time again. This was definitely the best airbnb apartment we have ever tried.  "
2025705,22116675,2017-03-16T09:55:25Z,Muy bien la verdad
2025705,11002489,2017-03-15T11:10:54Z,"As you can tell from the photos, the view was UNBELIEVABLE!  The giant picture windows and balcony were stunning.  The shower was pretty small/rough (as they all were in our travels), but there was plenty of hot water.  We enjoyed heating up our delicious leftovers in the great kitchenette.  The parking situation worked well, and the internet was AWESOME.  The bedroom was super-dark and the bed was pretty comfortable.  The location was WONDERFUL--solid restaurants around and right next to the funicular.  We walked to the lighthouse just down the road, and we were steps away from the Sitio.  Magical!"
2025705,89444453,2017-03-13T10:12:07Z,"Ottima accoglienza da parte di Marco e Argentina.
Marco ci ha dato molti utili consigli sulla zona e sui ristoranti per questa nostra veloce puntata a Nazarè.
Appartamento semplice e molto pulito, vista.......impagabile.
Noi eravamo due adulti e due ragazzi di 14 e si stava un po stretti, consiglierei la casa più per due persone, comunque per una notte e via e per quel panorama...... consigliabile!!!"

Argentina é uma anfitriã muito simpática e acolhedora. O apartamento é fantástico, tem todas as qualidades positivas possíveis, desde a localização, a vista cinematográfica, decoração. Tudo impecável. Muito obrigado Argentina e Marco. Voltando a Nazaré, sem dúvida alguma vou me hospedar em seu apartamento!!!"
2025705,16361072,2017-03-05T10:55:04Z,Great stop between Lisabon and Porto with spectaculair views from the apartment. Had great diner in the village right at the bottom of the stairs. Great location and good communiciation and welcome on arrival. 
2025705,117091592,2017-03-01T08:11:19Z,"Best location with the breathtaking view from the balcony. It takes you 2min to the funicular platform. You can also enjoy your night at the pub on the first floor of the house. 
The flat is compact but well equipped. Hot water is available whenever you want. Reasonable price is another merit. Argentina's husband helped us park our car nearby.
We loved it!

3852221,10588967,2017-05-01T18:32:46Z,Wow what a view!!! Stunning and easy accesss to the beach.  Thanks guys for a very relaxing stay. Shane and Maru were very accommodating. Slept like a baby! Clean and stylish apartment. Thank you both! 
3852221,25663627,2017-04-30T13:25:21Z,"This is my second time booking one of Shane and Marus airbnbs. Everything is as described and everything looks exactly like the pictures. The entire place is clean and has everything you possibly need for your time in Miami. They pay attention to everything and even accommodated us with our early check in. I will only book through them for my yearly Miami trips and have recommended them to my friends as well. I will say the only negative is the building itself since it's shared by other businesses, the lobby is VERY busy. I highly suggest not bringing your car here and just take advantage of the uber (there are plenty and often cheap). The valet lines are crazy long and I've seen some frustrated people. Not the valet's fault, it's just very crowded and people are impatient. Save yourself the headache and take uber. Thank you Shane and Maru! Please open your own hotel!!!  "
3852221,1039377,2017-04-28T19:24:55Z,"Shane and Maru's place was overlooking the ocean. Waking up to sunrise and seeing the sunset is simply beautiful. The beach is neat and clean. The unit comes stocked with beach chairs, umbrellas and other accessories. "
3852221,120877201,2017-04-25T18:39:18Z,"The view from the room was amazing, a wonderful way to start your day. The room was very clean and well equipped.
We will definitely stay again! "

3852221,100811797,2017-03-29T15:26:04Z,I loved the view of the beach rite in the back of condo .extra supplies inside condo so pack lite 
3852221,50679371,2017-03-24T13:23:11Z,"Very good communication with hosts, easy checking in and out and all over beautiful apartment. Thank you so much!"
3852221,13101850,2017-03-20T12:33:40Z,The ocean view turns the whole room blue and makes it feel like you're on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean. Pretty spectacular! The place has been really well maintained and has all the basic necessities. 
3852221,77837823,2017-03-18T14:31:52Z,Shane and Maru are the best hosts ever. Their condo is absolutely amazing and beautiful! It has everything you need and more. By far this is the best place I have ever stayed!
3852221,28368143,2017-03-11T14:41:18Z,Great view ! Right on the beach ! Clean and modern unit !  The only downside is that the building was very busy but we should have known better with it being spring break . Overall a great stay and very good hosts. We will definitely come back when it's not spring break ! 
3852221,10946998,2017-03-10T13:13:21Z,"Fantastic experience. Shane and Maru go above and beyond. The view is incredible. The location worked well, especially if you like walking, which we did both north to Bal Harbour and south to South Beach. Highly recommend! "
3852221,31284972,2017-03-07T14:20:35Z,"Had a fantastic stay. The room was gorgeous with a beautiful view of the ocean. The room was peaceful, clean and tranquil. We were incredibly comfortable and enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend this airbnb."
3852221,54924711,2017-03-02T14:55:20Z,"Shane and Maru's place looked more beautiful than it did on the photos, it was very clean and modern. There was very good communication and they are very kind. We really liked the location because we were in the center of Miami Beach. Not too far from South Beach and Bal Harbour. We recommend this place for any occasion really, and definitely will to friends and family. Definitely a must try and a great experience! 

A big thanks to you again!"
3852221,46012755,2017-03-01T06:37:14Z," Beautiful waterfront view to enjoy the beautiful sunset and sunrises of Miami!  Shane and Maru are available for anything you might need , very helpful and communicative.  We very much appreciated the packet of information re: local restaurants and things to do.  This is the way to see Miami!"
3852221,45477962,2017-02-25T16:54:53Z,"The apartment was high up in a large building, with a magnificent view. While we were there, the beach was being renourished and once that's finished, will be wide and lovely. We had a bit of inconvenience from that. 
Also, at certain times of the day, waiting for the elevator was a pain. But once you closed the door, the unit was lovely and calm, just as the picture showed."
3852221,40422362,2017-02-22T13:22:26Z,"Wonderful apartment, just as advertised. Shane and Maru were wonderful hosts, the amenities went above and beyond."
3852221,45611555,2017-02-19T14:25:38Z,"This place looks exactly like the pictures! The view is absolutely breathtaking and the beach is right behind the building so you don't have to worry about driving to the beach. It was super convenient that free valet parking was included in our stay, though as Shane and Maru warned it does take about 15 minutes to get your car around dinner time.

I probably wouldn't recommend staying here if you don't have a car although if you do want to uber places that is an option. I stayed here with my parents on a weekend trip to Miami and the apartment was more than large enough to accommodate the three of us. The sofa bed is definitely comfortable enough to spend a view nights on. 

We were in Miami for the Strictly Sailing portion of the Miami Boat Show, located right near the American Airlines arena and Biscayne Boulevard. We ate at Cvi Che 105, an upscale peruvian place in downtown Miami with great ceviche per its namesake, Joe's Stone Crab, a South Beach institution which my parents have eaten at for twenty years, Pubbelly, a trendy asian fusion style tapas restaurant near South Beach, and grabbed some fish sandwiches made to order on our way to the airport at the Poseidon Fish & Meat Market in North Beach. Overall we had a great trip and this apartment was wonderful! Shane and Maru left a list of food and attractions to visit that can help you find a restaurant or destination to suit your needs."
3852221,45403672,2017-02-08T15:44:21Z,"I highly recommend Shane and Maru's beachfront studio. The apartment looks just like it does in the photos- newly renovated and very clean. Shane and Maru responded quickly to any questions, and they stocked the apartment with everything you could need for the beach (beach chairs, umbrellas, sunblock, snorkel gear, etc...) The best part of the place is the super comfortable king size bed that overlooks the ocean. There is a restaurant and bar inside the condo and there's also a tiki bar outside by the pool. It was a great stay and I hope to return again. Thanks Shane and Maru!"
3852221,110522256,2017-02-05T16:43:55Z,"Lovely place. Very romantic setting. Lots of services and amenities available. Russian and Turkish baths, bike rental, shops, tennis etc..."
3852221,17373959,2017-02-02T16:07:31Z,Shane and Maru are amazing hosts! The location was absolutely amazing and the unit was beyond beautiful. This has been my best experience through air bnb and I highly recommend them. They really know about hospitality and know how to treat their clients. 
5540170,7985542,2017-05-04T06:27:58Z,Great location in a traditional shanghainese housing complex redecorated in a tasteful modern style. Highly recommend

5540170,100745635,2017-04-11T02:13:27Z,"This is a really cozy apartment in a quiet neighborhood. The pictures are very accurate. It's the perfect place for a couple. Also, the location is really convenient for travel via the subway (Line 10, 1, and 12). We would definitely come back. The entrance to the building was a bit surprising (narrow, crowded alley), but only because it's a historic residential community. Great place!"
5540170,14915079,2017-04-09T00:43:35Z,"很舒服的床和枕头,觉得吹风机很好用,虽然不知道为什么. 楼梯有些陡不适合老人住。 家很干净,整洁,地理位置超级超级棒!"

5540170,21081687,2017-03-20T01:05:04Z,"Joan's place is ideally located in the French concession near line 1 and 10 and 12. Its is a short walk from iconic YongKangLu which lost most of its bars in the past year (due to noise complaints). The apartment is located in small alley that can seem a little intimidating but once reached offers a great resting place free of noise. The washroom would be my only small nitpick. It is both the bathroom and the toilet. But since, it is an older building which makes it completely understandable. Everything needed is in the apartment, towels, water and a couple of coffee pods.  For an extended stay, there is also a kitchenette should you need to cook (I didn't). Overall, I was very pleased with the stay and it was all very reasonably priced."
5540170,66702348,2017-02-26T01:11:27Z,"Joan's apartment is exactly as advertised: clean, cozy and convenient. The apartment is located in a gated community - almost like a Hutong, and really gives you a communal, local living experience. It is only about a 5-10 minute walk from 3 metro lines, and is close to restaurants, cafes, bars and convenience stores. 

The apartment itself has all the necessary amenities. We loved the high ceilings, the hardwood floors, the natural light, and the small balcony that overlooks one of the alleys in the community.

Joan was also a fantastic host - very quick to respond to questions, helpful with restaurant recommendations, and committed to making the stay as pleasant as possible. She was very meticulous in giving directions to the apartment, and even sent through detailed instructions on how to work the apartment's heating unit as it wasn't obvious how the A/C unit could be used as a heater. 

I would definitely recommend this apartment!"
5540170,66822528,2017-02-24T00:46:10Z,"非常失望的一次入住,虽然照片上看不错,我12点入住的,下午5点就退租了。房间里就一个空调,还是坏的,不能制热,虽然有电暖炉,但是开了几个小时整个房间还是冷的,冻的不行,然后想去洗个热水澡!没想到热水器一会烫的可以泡茶,一会冰冷的。最后只能钻被子,还只有一条被子....不得已当天下午果断退租,还希望房东赶快改进,这样的细节实在让人失望。"

The accommodation would suit any budget traveller looking to be in Shanghai and transport is easy walking distance. The alleyway to the apartment may seem sketchy and dark at night but we were assured the city itself is pretty safe.

We also accidentally left a pouch with a large sum of money in the room when we checked out. We wrote to Yan, and she wired the entire amount back to our home country through Western Union.

The apartment itself is so beautiful exactly the same as the pictures and also have the simple needs like the towel, water, and toothbrush. I like the view from the swimming pool area very relaxing and also the ambiance.

2.가격
5점만점 3.5점 모든 리뷰에서 써있듯이 그냥 옥상 수영장 하나 때문에 다들 선택한듯, 수영장 빼면 그냥 그럼.. 일단 누구든 방 예약전에 무조건 에어컨 닦아 달라고 하세요... 에어컨 처음에 보고 기겁함... 옛날 벽걸이 에어컨인데 이거 내부청소 해야하는게 당연한건데 언제 닦았는지 곰팡이 엄청 많음 진짜 한 몇년 안닦은듯... 닦아야 한다는 개념이 없는건지 뭔지 잘 모르겠음  방콕 시내 돌아다니고 싶으시면 여기 잡으면좀  살짝 불편함 차가 무조건 막히기때문에 힘듬 그냥 좋은 수영장 떄문에 다들 고른듯 쿠폰가격부터 합산해서 싼거지 위치,시설,서비스 고려하면 싸다고 느껴지지는 않음

가드분들이 계시고 치안이 매우 훌륭했음

*추가
커피포트가 있어서 라면을 끓여먹을려고 했는데
커피포트안에 물때까 몇년된게 굳어서 커피포트안에 떡하니 있었음 마치 그 모습은 장판교의 장비같았음 친구는 어떻게든 신라면을 끓여먹을려고 새벽에 그거 하나 닦아 보겠다고 별짓을 다했지만 결국 못닦음 키 180넘고 거구인 내 친구도 그걸 못닦음 (군대에서 식판 1000판 넘게 닦아보고 고기판도 닦은 놈임)  누가 생각없이 커피포트 써서 뭐 끓여먹다가 타지에서 아플까봐 걱정되서 리뷰씀 
또한 개인적으로 스케쥴에 차질이 생겨서 혹시 환불이 될수 있냐고 물어봤음 안되도 별 상관은 없었음 얼마 되지 않는 돈이라서 사실 에어컨관련 불만도 있어서 숙소를 바꾸고도 싶었고 (기관지가 안좋아서) 근데 끝까지 답장을 안해줘서 매우 섭섭했음... 답장 계속 기달렸는데 몇일후에 방청소한다고 자기 할말만 딱 말하고 끝;
얼마든지 물어보라고 해놓고 택시비 얼마나 나올지 물어봤는데 답장도 안해줌... 참고로 택비시는 위에 써놨듯이 100바트~120바트 미터찍구 가셈
여기 아줌마가 숙소 뭐 이 주소 보여주라고 메세지 보내주는데 그거 보여주는순간 가격은 4배 이상 뛰게 되어있음 차가운 도시남자 처럼 그냥 bts 사판콰이 next to post office 하면 정가로 갈수있음

ps. 화장실 물 꼭 2번 내리셈 남녀끼리 왔으면 3번 내리셈 수압 약해서 같이온사람 똥 찌끄레기 보게됨 (매우중요 나는 친구꺼 강제로 계속 봄)

6561675,102248991,2017-02-06T04:22:26Z,I had an amazing stay at this place. This studio is perfect for someone who's travelling on his own or for a couple. I really loved the rooftop swimming-pool

6561675,47467000,2017-01-27T03:47:54Z,Quiet Neighbourhood away from main shopping belt but BTS station was right at the doorstep! Pretty cosy apartment with all basic amenities provided. Great for couples wanting to be away from noise but still not too far off from the City centre! 
6561675,48286417,2017-01-25T03:29:21Z,Great place! But little bit small than I imagine.
6561675,83123787,2017-01-23T01:47:58Z,"Our stay was great. She helped us a lot during our stay. Before we arrived we got lot of info about bkk, transportation and everything. Nothing went wrong with our stay. Skytrain 30seconds walk. Stores around in every corner. Great staff and security. With one word AWESOME!"
1668644,30767753,2017-05-13T17:13:02Z,Arian is a very accomodating host and the space is perfect for a beach get a way. 
1668644,41847550,2017-04-25T15:06:58Z,"The apartment is in a great location, short walk to beach and to nightlife/restaurants. Arian is great, he met us at the apartment and was really helpful giving us tips on where to go etc. The apartment was lovely and well equipped. Couldn't recommend more! "
1668644,115947265,2017-04-18T15:02:54Z,Le condo est à l'image des photos présentées; très propre et rénové. Situé dans un quartier tranquille et sécuritaire et à quelques blocs de la mer. Transport en commun juste à côté. Arian est un hôte très sympathique et accueillant. Ces suggestions ont été très appréciées. Nous recommandons fortement.  
1668644,14266752,2017-04-13T13:08:41Z,Die Wohnung ist super super sauber und schön! Die Lage ist der Hammer! Parken mit dem Auto kostet 18$ die Nacht im Thyssen Building.

1668644,1318085,2017-03-29T13:08:42Z,This place was perfect!! It's in an amazing location and the style is so cute. I loved the upgraded furnishings and amazing window light. We were very comfortable and felt very safe. If you are looking to stay near the Deco district and walk to the. Each and restaurants this is the place for you!
1668644,31200134,2017-03-28T01:22:08Z,"We had a great stay in Arian's apartment. He is a very friendly host, very helpful and every time available.

El departamento es tal cual se muestra en la fotos, muy cómodo!"
1668644,98406177,2017-03-05T13:10:36Z,"Great studio apartment, 5 min walk to the beach and restaurants. Clean, exactly as described and pictured. No complaints. "
1668644,79242508,2017-02-20T15:26:15Z,"Arian is a great host. He was very responsive to all our queries.He helped us with easy check in and also suggested places to visit near by. He also helped us with geting car rentals and all his trip advice was very useful.
The place was very clean with all necessary ameneties. Is in a kind of residential area so not so much of (EMAIL HIDDEN) also very close to the beach and the ocean drive. Room size is a little cramped for 4 people - great for 2. However it is not a problem if you use the room just to crash at night like us. Highly recommended."
1668644,64685630,2017-02-15T13:23:55Z,"Arian was a great host, for anyone who is skeptical, there were NO pests, the apartment was exceptionally clean, the shower is to die for, and the bed is comfortable. His guide to restaurants and nightlife was awesome! There's an amazing restaurant up the street, Big Pink (MUST have the chicken and waffle benny). Everything is in walking distance and the area is clean and safe. 

He pushed our checkout time back an hour which was nice, but I wish he was a little more flexible for people who are leaving later on in the evening.

Next time we're in Miami we'll definitely be staying at Arian's place again. I couldn't imagine staying in a hotel! "
1668644,3910349,2017-02-12T17:16:53Z,Arian's place was great for my husband and i.  Very clean and had everything we needed for our stay in South Beach.  Arian was very friendly and provided great tips for places to eat and visit in the area.  He even helped us find parking and checked in to make sure all was good.  Would stay here again! 
1668644,95150891,2017-01-23T13:38:25Z,Very true depiction of the place in the photographs... close to the beach and a quick walk to ocean ave
1668644,13197838,2017-01-18T14:21:33Z,"Nos hemos hospedado en las propiedades de Arian, en nuestra prolongada estadía, en south Beach. Todas han sido magnificas. Hemos conocido un amigo en Miami. "

10801945,16832726,2017-03-11T23:36:46Z,Miae was so responsive and provided so much information about her home ahead of time. She was the best host! Also her apartment is in truly a great location - literally right outside the Hongik University Station stop. Would highly recommend if you are looking to stay in Hongdae!

10801945,104309921,2017-02-13T02:54:06Z,位置真的绝佳。就在地铁站旁边 电梯b1层直接可以进入地铁站。在韩国地铁比公交车方便很多很多 也更适合中国人。房间内非常整洁 冰箱 吹风机等设备都有。很好的一个体验 谢谢房主^^

10801945,110237043,2017-01-30T00:45:42Z,깨끗하고 친절하셔서 편히 있다왔어요
10801945,18067495,2017-01-29T00:58:45Z,"My sisters and I stayed in two of Miae's listings in the same apartment building. It's a very accessible location. When it says 1 minute away form the subway, that is very much true. Once you exit the building, its probably 5 steps away from the subway so that made it such a convenient location.

The surrounding establishments consisted of restaurants and small shops which gave off a hip vibe. You can definitely see a lot of youths around. A little walk will take you to a main road with more shops and easy access to bus stops if needed. Its a great place equipped with all the things you'll need.

Miae was a great host and answered any questions I had promptly. We did not get the chance to meet but she was accommodating nonetheless. Would definitely recommend her place!"
10801945,60215646,2017-01-25T23:48:38Z,This is a great place with excellent location. I would like to highly recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere in Hongik University area.

259518,8121129,2017-04-11T15:35:45Z,Great location! We had a great stay and the host was friendly and helpful.
259518,26108526,2017-04-06T15:29:48Z,Loved being able to walk downstairs and enjoy a great meal and nice beverages! 
259518,9438525,2017-04-02T13:32:54Z,This spot is great. Perfect location. Great main hang out space. Easy to get in and out. Clear communication with Meghan.
259518,7510001,2017-03-31T12:12:32Z,This loft will not disappoint. The location is so incredible. Everything you need for restaurants bars and shops are a walk away! An uber gets you to the casinos or art galleries and other amazing sites. We highly recommend for a getaway for one or two couples. It is very spacious and Meghan is a great host. 
259518,18587216,2017-03-27T13:09:15Z,An awesome place for a weekend! Really cool space in an awesome location
259518,17833772,2017-03-12T13:00:22Z,"Meghan's attention to beautiful design detail is evident throughout the entire place. It appeals to extravagance and restraint all at the same time. At first entry, it's all about taking it in and diving into all of the details. After that, you simply feel at home walking in through the door. "
259518,856877,2017-02-24T14:37:34Z,Best place to stay in Detroit. Love it.
259518,106392237,2017-01-17T15:55:13Z,Great location and fantastic apartment.
259518,101215996,2017-01-08T14:22:30Z,Perfect location for Corktown exploring and visit to Katoi
259518,23374580,2017-01-07T15:30:27Z,Thanks for the easy stay Meghan. Was my second stay and are looking forward to stay again next year!
259518,4270991,2016-12-29T16:10:05Z,"This place is a great base for exploring the city. Many Detroit neighbourhoods are isolated from one another, and this location gave us both a good central location for daytime roaming and the perfect nighttime locale for food and drink, with multiple great restaurants and two terrific bars (including an excellent distillery tasting room). Furthermore, an amazing coffeeshop is right downstairs to start each morning in the best possible way. Don't miss nearby Mexicantown, which is amazingly inexpensive and has possibly the best Mexican food outside the southwestern U.S. Detroit is fascinating, and I can't imagine a better Airbnb from which to explore this great American city."
259518,7443237,2016-12-11T13:50:36Z,"Honor & Folly made our visit in Detriot! In the center of one of the most exciting hubs in the city, Corktown, this loft is cozy, utilitarian and industrious, sweet, modern and midwestern all at once. You are in the perfect location for exploring Detroit. Eat at Slow's, Katoi, Mercury Bar and Gold Cash Cold, get coffee at Astros, shop for Vintage at El Dorado and Mama Koos. Buy a slice of pie from Sister Pie at The Farmer's Hand. Explore midtown, downtown and Eastern Market with a short uber ride from the loft and check out the abandoned Michigan Station, just a short walk away from the loft. 

Meghan and Maia were great at communicating and gracious in their recommendations and help. 

I always enjoy staying at new places each time I visit a city but I think I'll break that rule and stay at Honor & Folly every time. "
259518,5725313,2016-12-04T15:44:43Z,"amazing place to stay for a detroit weekend. unique and styled with an artist's eye. spacious, well stocked, convenient. one of the nicest airbnb's i've stayed in.
there is an AMAZING coffee shop downstairs, and a couple places on the block- but everything else is a short ride away. this is an urban setting, and parking is on the street or a lot nearby."
259518,4724897,2016-11-27T13:55:50Z,Fantastic place
259518,5789360,2016-11-16T15:54:56Z,"This was a lovely stay. The Corktown area is up-and-coming, and this particular apartment is a kind of ""pioneer"" in the area's renaissance. The neighborhood is active but the apartment is quiet, in an urban sort of way. This is a beautifully designed restoration of an historic building, with innovative design features as well as carefully curated historical artifacts, from creative quilts to a plate of old keys (!) to lovely, haunting early American portraits. I was there alone on business, but would love to come back with my family...just to enjoy this special location. The host was extremely helpful in sending check-in and area information. "
259518,19850763,2016-11-10T14:35:13Z,Amazing location. Amazing host. Beautiful place to sleep. Well done and worth it. I'll be back. 
259518,95206638,2016-11-07T14:28:34Z,The place was delightful. Huge and airy and interesting in a fun neighbourhood. Very cool design of an old space.  Plenty of room for 4 of us.  We loved the place and exploring Corktown and downtown on foot and other areas easily accessible by car. Meghan was quickly responsive to the few questions we had and got us a restaurant reservation we wanted. We booked 3 nights this time but would love to return in the future to hang out in the great space and see more of wonderful Detroit and its friendly people.
259518,100120106,2016-10-31T14:41:48Z,"This is a fantastic spot to stay if you are checking out Detroit. You never need to leave the block- amazing coffee, cocktails and food...."
86511,45073804,2017-04-16T08:54:44Z,What a fabulous little find in the very heart of Florence. I could not recommend this Airbnb more. It was a beautiful and charming Italian apartment surrounded by one of the most beautiful gardens I've ever been in. Sabina was a marvellous host and we very much enjoyed our stay here. 
86511,111159582,2017-04-12T08:54:00Z,Jardin de rêve et charme absolu à ... florence !
86511,31971508,2017-04-04T06:47:00Z,"The house (and the garden!) is just dreamlike. Better than the photos we both agreed. Her dogs the most welcoming. Just one problem: if you come by car (specially if its big) just let Sabina know in advance cause the entry is very very tricky and the traffic impossible in this street (in Florence in general but its central enough so you dont need it during the actual stay). Conclusion: we definetly do want to come back, specially now that we know how to get the car in!"
86511,16795697,2017-03-29T06:44:44Z,"Everything you've read about this charming apartment with great gardens is true. It really is a fabulous and unique space  
However when you're traveling you really want a good bed to sleep in and I'm afraid this wasn't the case. When I look back on previous reviews I noticed that someone in September 2016 also commented on the bad mattress. The mattress appears old. It is very uncomfortable and slopes into the middle. Our 4 nights here were our worst night sleeping of all the Airbnb's we stayed in. 
I would absolutely recommend Sabina's apartment if it had a better bed"
86511,7255331,2016-12-28T00:56:26Z,"Hands down, a favourite! Sabina offered a warm welcome to us. The flat is centrally located and yet an escape from it all. A perfect location for exploring Florence. Taxi from airport easy (€25) Accommodation very comfortable for two and kitchen well equipped. The property and gardens are spectacular and as many have said, just wishing I could keep this charming Italian flat as my own secret. Thank you Sabina for making our 2016 Christmas so memorable. "
86511,69854572,2016-10-09T01:50:09Z,"
Without any doubt this is a unique , most charming and romantic appartement in central Florence. Only a few minutes from the train Station SMN , hidden behind a high wall , you'll find a secret garden . The appartement is part of the adjacent buildings belonging to the palazzo which you can glimpse at the end of an alley lined with orange trees and statues.
The quaint space comprises a well furnished kitchen with access to the garden and leads some stairs up the living room, filled with art books, souvenirs and memorabilia of the owner, which make it very ,very personal. In one corner , there is a winding stair ,which brings you to the mezzanine , where you find the bedroom space and bathroom. The windows reaching from bottom to the roof let in light and views of the garden. Here you find peace and quiet after a day filled with the overwhelming impressions you take in while in Florence.
We stayed here for a pleasant week and we were happy to be here.
If we might offer some positive suggestions, which would not impair the quaint character, but increase the comfort: 
We would recommend to make the access to the appartement a little more attractive .
We would have appreciated a small table outside, where one could have either breakfast or a drink in the evening . ( we were there beginning October, so maybe it was too late in the season for this)  
The mattress was not very comfortable,
And finally the chipped bathtub with the big dark stain is not up to standard .

86511,2584509,2016-09-10T00:14:41Z,"Sabina's loft was absolutely beautiful. Very spacious, lots of natural light, tons of really neat antiques/collectables/art/books, a fully equipped kitchen and a stunning garden. It was the perfect accommodation for my  mother/daughter trip. We spent most of our first day roaming the property discovering different flowers/plants, tucked away buildings and sculptures, etc. Access to the loft and communication with Sabina was painless.  Sabina was very hospitable and even helped my exhausted mother with her bag which I am very grateful for. She also helped us by booking a taxi for morning of our departure. Sabina provides all guests with a binder full of recommendations and history of her family and the property. Wifi was great. Temperature throughout the loft both day and night was very comfortable. Baths in the antique tub were lots of fun! Location was convenient for us (very close to the train station). Lost of resraurants walking distance but cabs were also very afforable. It's perfect for those looking to relax and after a full day of sightseeing. Overall, a wonderful stay. My only regret was not having enough time to really enjoy the property as much as I would have liked since I was out most of the time sightseeing. My mother and I stayed in 4 different airbnb locations throughout our trip and this was definitely our favorite. I HIGHLY recommend!"
86511,6777540,2016-06-21T02:16:22Z,"I can't really begin to describe Sabina's place - a beautiful spacious, quirky, bohemian apartment converted from an old store area in the corner of the palace gardens. And that doesn't really begin to do it justice!

Sabina was busy hosting a glitzy fashion show in the palace gardens on the evening we arrived (which we joined later on for a couple of G&T's!) but she really took time to show us around the house - she was lovely and made sure we had a great reception. Her family have a fascinating story, going back hundreds of years as one of the most important Florentine families, and it was fun imagining what had taken place at the Palace over the years!

The apartment has a great kitchen with all appliances, aircon, wifi, relaxing places to sit and unwind, and a very comfortable bed (most importantly!). The main entrance is into a small rustic gatehouse which leads through private gates onto the busy street outside - such a world of difference once you step through the gates! You can also access the gardens directly from the kitchen.

The gardens are so peaceful and a beautiful place for a relaxing walk in the morning or the evening - it was very uplifting playing with the dogs and seeing the tortoises, smelling all the beautiful plants, and generally just recharging the batteries after a long day walking the busy streets.

I can't fault Sabina or her hospitality and the apartment is just amazing - we would love to stay again some day.

My main concern is that this place will be booked constantly once you discover it!"
86511,56115327,2016-06-05T03:38:49Z,"Located a short walk from the historic sites, Sabina's home is a magical oasis in the already beautiful city of Florence. Sabina provided a very helpful handbook with fantastic recommendations of restaurants, shops, important numbers (such as how to call for a Taxi) as well as a brief history of the Corsini family/property (loved this!!!). We wish we had more time to spend in the stunning gardens with the turtles, the dogs, the lemon trees... It was like a dream. Will definitely return."
86511,968827,2016-05-31T02:40:33Z,"I enthusiastically agree with prior guest Franziska that Sabina's garden loft is ""something straight out of the movies!"" Behind the high, nondescript walls of a busy street in downtown Firenze lies a tranquil garden paradise.  Casa dei Corsini looks over a magnificent expansive garden with stone statues, lemon trees (if not in the grand lemon house for winter storage), and charmingly plodding tortoises wandering here and there just past the kitchen window. There is also the incomparably loveable Zucca, Sabina's wired hair fox terrier, who stole my heart and was always welcome to visit (I so very much missed my own Jack Russell terrier on this extended trip to Italy - Zucca was an excellent adoptee) The apartment is nestled in the opposite corner of the main Corsini Manor on a vast in-city estate I never knew was here. I lived in Firenze for a year in college and must have walked by the walls of the estate a thousand times but never dreamed what beautiful treasures were on the other side! The interior is beautifully done - it's a very personal, charming space with photos, books, and objets d'art that made us feel we were staying with friends who were kindred spirits. Sabina welcomed us personally with fresh cut peonies from her garden (my favorite!) and set us up for a lovely stay with breakfast treats and a bottle of wine from her family vineyard. The apartment is easy walking distance to the train station and you can walk into the city center on foot in about 15 min., but when you return to the apartment you feel like your miles away on a Tuscan farm. A much-appreciated refuge when you've been exploring the city all day. Sabina was a wonderful host, making sure we had everything we needed while respecting our privacy. She also emailed me within hours of my departure to alert me to the fact I have left behind a very sentimental (and valuable) pearl necklace and she worked quickly and diligently to arrange to send it to me back in Seattle. What an angel! I would highly recommend staying here to my friends and family, and we will certainly return when we again visit Firenze. In fact we are thinking of asking Sabina about having a wedding reception in the garden. While we were there, there was a wedding party with about 75 guests and they transformed the garden into a nighttime fairyland with lots of string garden lights twinkling, music and a dance floor. It was so enjoyable (and rare) to be able to experience such a happy festivity in another country - it has become an unexpected and cherished memory of our time in Firenze. Thank you, Sabina!"
86511,165320,2016-05-06T03:45:06Z,"Sabina's garden loft is something straight out of the movies. Behind the high walls of a busy street lies a quiet garden paradise and lodgings fit for the ""princess and the gardener"". The interior is beautifully done. It's a very personal, charming space and we loved staying here.

Sabina welcomed us with fresh cut flowers from her garden and set us up for a lovely stay. The apartment is super close to the train station and you can walk into the city center on foot in about 10 Minutes. We would absolutely go back if we ever visited Firenze again. This one is a true gem!"
86511,9023950,2016-04-25T02:40:21Z,"The photos are accurate and the place is characterful and practical in a nearby location. The apartment cost more than what we usually spend on AirBnb trips, but it seemed to be the going rate for a good location with outdoor area, parking space at short notice. Personally I wouldn't book this apartment again but I appreciate many people have had comfortable stays here. The garden area really is a lovely feature. We didn't meet Sabina as she was away and I wonder if standards of cleanliness slipped because of this. 
Access to the parking space is very tight and we damaged our hire car which is our own fault, but next time we'd probably pay the extra fee to leave the hire car in Florence and rent accommodation without parking. "
86511,10619569,2016-04-18T12:15:03Z,"My wife and I stayed at Sabina's apartment while on vacation and found the location to be convenient as well as a relaxing retreat from the bustle of the city. The photos describe the property accurately and we had no issues while staying. Sabina was there to meet us on arrival and departure, leaving us a bottle of wine from her family's vineyard as well as some basics for breakfast. 

This was our priciest AirBnb while in Italy, but also most unique. We enjoyed our time in Florence and would stay again.  
"
86511,1750831,2016-03-20T17:47:10Z,"My Husband and I stayed at Sabina's beautiful garden loft for 5 days while traveling around Italy.  This beautiful apartment is close to the train station and all major attractions in Florence, but because of the location and the gorgeous property when you are in the apartment you feel like your miles away on a Tuscan farm.  A wonderful refuge when you've been exploring the city all day.  Sabina was a wonderful host, made sure we had everything we needed and also respected our privacy. The gardens on the grounds are simply gorgeous and peaceful.  I would happily recommend staying here to any of my friends and family, and we will certainly return if we are ever back in Florence! "
86511,47116218,2016-03-11T14:14:35Z,"A truely unique experience set behind a large stone walled garden, thus providing tranquility and privicy from the hustle and bustle of Florence.  Rustic in its style, but still very elegant, Casa del Corsini looks over a magnificant garden with stone statues and lemon trees (if not in the grand lemon house for winter storage) and the loft apartment is nestled in the opposite corner of the main Corsini Manor.  Fully equipped for a lovely cosy stay, Sabina was always on standby should you need help during your stay as well as supporting us in finding this gem of hers!
We loved it, Ben & Georgie."
86511,28470833,2015-11-19T12:23:01Z,"This was our first experience with Air BnB and I think we'll be forever spoiled. Sabina met us at the apartment on time and with a lovely stock of essentials - coffee, tea, bread, butter, milk, and fruit. The apartment is better than pictured because there is no way to capture the charm of this lovely oasis that one feels in person. You become a small part of the community of people who care for and inhabit the six acres of paradise found inside the walls in the middle of the bustling city. The fruit on the trees, the dogs playing with their toys, and the roses in bloom are the finishing touches on the ""patina"" of history you find here. It is walking distance to most everything (including the train station at SMN), taxis are easy to find if you want to venture further, and Sabina's list of recommended restaurants, bakeries, etc., is very helpful. There are neighborhood stores for all your wants and needs, and Sabina is easily contacted by phone, email, or text message should you need her. We will return to Firenze and would not dream of staying anywhere else. We will, however, bring mosquito repellent. Even in mid-November, they're numerous and hungry. Thanks again, Sabina, for a magical trip."
86511,31073783,2015-10-13T11:07:39Z,This was a great space. Really nice to have during an extended stay. The kitchen is well appointed. I appreciated having laundry facilities and a Tub!! Handy location. On oasis really. The garden area is beautiful. Great space for artists.

86511,5955326,2015-09-12T14:41:16Z,"A lovely hidden gem in Florence, set in a private garden only a few minutes walk from the main Florence rail station and about 10 minutes walk from the heart of Florence itself. We were made very welcome by Sabina's son who showed us round the apartment which is exactly as described  in the listing. The apartment felt like ""home"" and if we had been staying more than a week we would have spent more time at the apartment in very relaxing surroundings. We had to contact Sabina a couple of times during the week and she was very quick to respond and deal with our questions. This apartment is thoroughly recommended."
86511,41345996,2015-09-04T15:04:17Z,"Sabina a été très accueillante et on s'est sentis comme chez nous tout de suite. Le loft est très cosy, et le jardin exceptionnel.
Une excellente adresse, à réserver les yeux fermés!"
7125266,109503168,2017-05-04T13:17:53Z,Orialis's place is very nice and clean. Me and my two freinds only stayed here one night.The building has lovely high ceilings and the room we stayed in had a very clean newly renovated bathroom. I would recommend this place for anyone visiting Havana. 
7125266,120637363,2017-04-28T15:58:24Z,"Una casa muy cómoda, bonita y con un ambiente familiar; y los  anfitriones son realmente agradables. Muy recomendada. "
7125266,33849454,2017-04-26T20:01:50Z,Sehr schönes Zimmer in einem super schönen Haus. Das Frühstück war fantastisch und die Gastgeber super nett. Wir haben uns sehr willkommen gefühlt :)
7125266,8976620,2017-04-24T15:13:21Z,"I stayed at Oralis B&B for two nights during my visit to Cuba. She was easy to communicate with before my stay and was flexible about my arrival time. I stayed with 2 other friends and we all have private rooms that were spacious, clean and well kept. The location was perfect; a few minutes from many restaurants, and el malecón. My friends and I were very comfortable there and felt very welcomed. All rooms were spacious and each had a big bathroom (in-room) and were very nice and clean. The staff is also very friendly and they are all thoughtful hosts; everyone made sure my friends and I had everything we needed during our stay and gave us tips about getting around in town. This was by far my best experience with Airbnb, and I couldn't be more satisfied. I will definitely recommend It to anyone who's looking for an exceptional room with a great host!"
7125266,56038890,2017-04-23T10:36:37Z,Will follow 
7125266,6996018,2017-04-16T14:13:46Z,"I gave this place 5 stars because it was absolutely perfect. My family and I stayed here for just over a week and enjoyed every minute of our stay. Oralis, David, Honorio and exercise were always helpful and accommodating.  From the moment we arrived to the day we left they were able to answer any questions we had. 
Yusleidis (Muneca) is the amazing cook. The food was great. We had breakfast every morning and were never disappointed. Our family decided to eat dinner at the house a few of the days as well because we loved the food and the company.  
The place overall was very clean, the beds were comfortable and their was a private bathroom in every room. Our group was large so we booked the whole place. Every family member was pleased with the room. On our plane flight home all we did was talk about how lucky we were to find such a wonderful place. 
Not only was the inside of the place great, but the location was perfect as well. We were a few blocks from the Hotel National, Habana Libre, Malecon and many restaurants. It is a short cab ride to Old Havana, we even walked it when we felt like some exercise (about a 30 minute walk) If you want to have a great time, talk to some wonderful people and truly enjoy your time in Havana stay here. I can't wait to go back and I would definitely stay here again. "
7125266,7358277,2017-04-08T14:38:48Z,Orealis and her family were so welcoming and friendly - they made our stay so enjoyable. The house is in a good residential neighbourhood but easy to get to central Havana - it was very comfortable 
7125266,101673297,2017-03-18T12:21:21Z,We had an amazing visit-the employees and house were just perfect! We felt at home and they prepared the best food. Thank you so much- we hope to return soon! 
7125266,3931486,2017-03-14T12:55:54Z,"Perfectly restored historically house. Loved interior design, decor and furnishings. Bed extremely comfortable. Hot shower greatly appreciated. House and kitchen team were wonderful. Accommodating my need for hot water while I nursed a vacation cold was above and beyond. A little confusion about the scheduling of a taxi ride. Though it all sorted out in the end. All in all a great place to stay in downtown Havana.
"
7125266,51373936,2017-03-07T15:38:19Z,It was a wonderful stay and one of the best airbnb experiences ever. The hosts are very friendly and helpful for planning activities and tours. The breakfast was very filling and so worth the price. We also added dinners where we enjoyed the local cuisine. They made everything simple and easy for us including transportation service from Joelle. By the end we felt like family. 
7125266,423405,2017-02-28T14:26:15Z,"If I could I'd give a lot more stars than five to Orialis's place. We had a group of nearly 30 in Vedado for 8 days to study Cuban choral singing with local choir directors. Orialis generously gave us free reign of her centrally-located Vedado house to rearrange furniture and use for our rehearsals. Orialis was out of town but her house manager/cook Muñeca made for an amazing, welcoming hostess—and her cooking is supreme! If you stay here, be sure to ask for dinners as well as breakfasts. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with lovely, upscale ensuite bathrooms. The room at the top of the stairs, in particular, is luxurious, with its own balcony, and the double-pane windows shut out a lot of the street noise. The only drawback to Orialis' location is the sometimes heavy traffic outside, which can occasionally be bothersome in the living room. The bedrooms are located in the interior of the building, however, and noise isn't really a problem there. I will absolutely come back to Orialis's place, both with our next singing group and when I come back to Cuba with my family. I'm definitely coming back many times to this amazing country, and mostly because of hosts like this!"
7125266,110030894,2017-02-20T14:53:16Z,Très bien situé à proximité du Malecon. Belle maison ancienne avec un accueil très sympathique.

Le dîner nous attendait à la maison avec un menu de poissons des plus délicieux. Nos chambres étaient soignées, décorées avec goût mais un peu bruyantes (on vit la nuit à la Havane), les conseils et l'hospitalité étaient précieux. Un grand merci à tous pour tant de gentillesse ! Merci aussi pour vos sourires. Amitiés de France. Magali"

Aimé, la responsable de atender la casa, es una persona simpatiquísima, atenta y dispuesta a ayudar. Nos recibió con un café muy rico y ofreció helados a los chicos. El desayuno es abundante, muy casero, con bebidas calientes, frutas, jugos, dulces, manteca, panes y huevos. A pedido nuestro, nos prepararon de merienda unos sandwichs de jamón y queso excelentes. Nos resolvieron todos los problemas y dudas y nos consiguieron un taxista de confianza para ir hasta el aeropuerto. Todo muy bien. "
7125266,36973138,2017-02-01T16:53:04Z,"Beautiful, comfortable house with extremely helpful staff. Breakfast was absolutely delicious. Totally worth the 5 CUC. Centrally located for walks around Vedado. Close to the famous Malecon. A board games night with staff and friends was a blast!"
7125266,91468340,2017-01-28T15:06:33Z,"Excellent colonial house in Havana, I would go again without hesitation! It is located 5 minutes walking from the Malecon and National de Cuba Hotel. To go to Old Havana you can either walk (app 30 minutes) or take a cab (5 minutes ride for max 10 CUCs). The house is built on 2 levels, on the ground floor there are 3 rooms, a nice lobby, 2 small patios, a dining room and the kitchen. On the first floor there is one room more, the biggest one, having a balcony as well, but nosier as it faces the street. The whole house is nicely decorated, with some slightly signs of fatigue which give you a old colonial feeling, but it is extremely clean and beautiful in terms of architecture. Rooms are spacious and have very high ceilings, we rented the whole house and I had the chance to see them all. Food is very good, we tried both the breakfast and dinner, I would recommend the breakfast every day and the dinner at least once. Orialis has been very helpful and answered to all our questions, gave us suggestions about what to see, where to go, by what means of transportation etc. And the last but not least, the people taking care of the house and us (Aymeet, Muñeca and Orialis’s cousin) have really touched our hearts! Go there and you will be on good hands!"

One of the fancier places we stayed and very centrally located for Havana.  "

2749954,25145482,2017-05-01T08:51:25Z,"The photos are accurate.  The apartment is very quiet.  Although you need to be careful about making noise in the courtyard, which is very reverberant, you do not have to worry after you shut the front door.  This is a great area, next door to the Canal St. Martin and the famous bridges one of which appears in the iconic film ""Hôtel du Nord.""  Segire is a great host, very attentive and quick to respond as she lives not far away."

2749954,11627326,2017-04-17T08:14:04Z,"This is an amazingly cool place to stay. It is close to everything, shop, stores, restaurants and metro, with which you are in the main tourist area with couple of stops. Since there is a university in the area, the crowd is young and lively. We stayed 6 people including my young kids and truly enjoyed the space. The house decor is rustic with abundant lights coming from sky windows. The kitchen has all the appliances you will need. This will be our place when we come back to Paris. Segire is a great person and she was responsive for all of our inquiries and gave us a great tip for local places. "
2749954,61239583,2017-04-06T07:05:07Z,"The main living area is a beautiful top-lit space with a big table - great for a large group. Take notice of what Segire says about the bedrooms: some would not be very comfortable. Because of the skylights this house would be extremely hot in high summer.
It is in a cool Shoreditchy area but more normal Paris is just up the hill behind the street. The canal is a joy, both to walk along and to enjoy from a boat (good commentary in English and French). 
The restaurant next door (La Cantine St Quentin I think) is only open for lunch but is excellent. We also enjoyed Chez Maurice, which is jolly and traditional. It wasn't easy to find a café for breakfast before 10am but further up Rue Bichat there are two bar/cafes that do coffee and croissants. The Franprix supermarket round the corner from the house has a DIY orange squeezing machine for breakfast at home.
I enjoyed the Musee de Montmartre and the open-air metro ride to get to it.
The Sunday morning market up the road is better than Segire suggests and certainly worth shopping at. Marche d'Aligre, near Bastille, is wonderful."
2749954,31875014,2017-04-01T07:49:43Z,"Segire is an amazing host!  She helped to arrange for a birthday cake for my youngest daughter, as we were celebrating an 8th birthday the day we arrived.  Segire went out of her way to offer tips about the neighborhood and help with some traveling emergencies.   She is a spectacular person!  This was our second time staying with Segire, our kids love her house and feel at home.  I don't think we will ever be able to stay anywhere else in Paris!!"
2749954,39629548,2017-03-26T09:28:57Z,"I can't recommend this place enough - beautiful house, perfect location on the canal and Segire was incredibly helpful on arrival and provided us with fantastic recommendations. Will definitely be back!"

2749954,24054178,2017-02-10T10:02:00Z,"L'accueil de Segire et l'emplacement du logement nous avait enchanté.
Mais nous avons été époustouflé par le logement en lui-même. J'ai rarement séjourné dans un lieu aussi exceptionnel, en plein coeur de Paris, à 2 pas de toute commodité.
Pour une fois, nous avions juste envie de nous retrouver ""à la maison"", car nous partagions tous le sentiment d'être vraiment chez nous.
J'espère pouvoir revenir très prochainement.
Merci encore Segire."

"
2749954,8015418,2017-01-31T07:48:23Z,"Coming from 40 degrees in Australia we were slightly concerned about the Paris winter and heating, I can assure prospective guests the heating is excellent in Segire's house.  WIFI is strong and fast. The quietness of the house was something we had not expected. It is completely silent at night, not a sound to be heard, although when someone goes to the bathroom the floors are very squeaky. Beds were firm but comfortable.

The house has a wonderful relaxed provincial style. Lighting is soft and warming. Incidentally most natural lighting comes from skylights as opposed to windows, which works fine. 

The rooms tend to be quite small and there is very limited space for clothing. We had hoped to unpack for our eight night stay, but unfortunately worked out of suitcases. 

The sofas are not comfortable and inviting. You do not feel like lounging about and tend to sit at the dining table instead. Sumptuous sofas would make a big difference. 

The area is great. Not pretentious at all. Lots of great places to eat and drink. 

We had 5 in our party and there was more than enough space. I think it would start to get quite tight with more than 8.

All in all a lovely stay. Thanks Segire. "
2749954,41917662,2017-01-23T10:25:40Z,"We had a great stay here. Segire is welcoming and informative. The loft has so much charm and is in a fabulous are, we would stay again!"

The location clos to the canal St. Martin was also perfect: quiet but close to great shops, groceries and restaurants. Many metro statiosn nearby."
2749954,33008537,2017-01-04T02:39:13Z,"Segire's Little House in Paris was perfect for our recent family reunion over the New Year! 7 adults and 4 kids were accommodated really well. The charm of the building as you enter the courtyard was exactly what we wanted. There was even a lovely little lit up Christmas tree in the foyer waiting for us. The kitchen worked well and the open living dining suited the family. There were plenty of towels and the washer/dryer set up was brand new. The house was warmed beautifully with radiators and a fireplace. There are two fabulous boulangeries within a five minute walk so we enjoyed fresh, delicious croissants and other goodies every morning. The market directly around the corner provided us with everything else we needed. 

Segire was helpful and communicative with us throughout the process of booking and our stay. 

I'd recommend the Little House to any family or group looking for a rustic and charming experience. "

Tide pools in front of building are fun.  Charl was very helpful when our train from Johannesburg arrived very late;. he sent his driver who helped get us into the apartment.  Excellent kitchen set up with all the dishes and utensils.  Washer and dryer was very appreciated!!!"
11112236,23271633,2017-04-25T06:25:59Z,"We had a great time, and we enjoyed our stay in this wonderful modern apartment and spectacular view of the ocean. You will find everything you need and more. The apartment location is also very good, using a car you can easily reach a lot of resturants and shops."
11112236,12274881,2017-04-23T06:37:54Z,"Eine tolle Wohnung mit grandioser Sicht aufs Meer und genug Platz für 6 erwachsene Personene. Die Wohnung bietet alles, was für einen gelungenen Aufenthalt nötig sit. Charles war ein wunderbarer Gastgeber, sehr entgegenkommend, hilfsbereit und freundlich. Die Kommunikation war perfekt. Wir hatten eine unvergessliche Zeit in Kapstadt und würden gerne bald wiederkommen.
Absolute Weiterempfehlung!"
11112236,2524286,2017-04-13T06:29:41Z,"This is the best place you can stay with a big group in Cape Town. The ocean view is simply unbelievable! The place is very clean and nice, and includes everything you can dream to live for a short period in Cape Town. Communication was perfect. 100% recommended. "
11112236,56326296,2017-04-07T06:39:02Z,Great spacious place with amazing views. Charl is a very welcoming host and he made sure everything was handled perfectly. We will book this place again next time. 
11112236,37396340,2017-03-27T07:46:22Z,"In all respects excelent from the first minute to the last.   One lacked for nothing, even to the friendliness of the building manager."
11112236,108599811,2017-03-07T07:55:25Z,"If you wake up and don't hear the waves of the ocean and smell of seaweed, you haven't woken up in Cape Town. This apartment has it all. A lovely place for 5/6 people. Just no balcony, but you should be sitting on the rocks anyways. "
11112236,82690502,2017-01-18T07:49:32Z,Muy lindo el departamento muy bien ubicado al frente del mar. Cumplió con todo lo prometido

11112236,54178785,2016-11-22T06:15:59Z,From the get go all communication was prompt and friendly. I also appreciated being contacted during my stay to check that all was well-this was a good touch.

Monica was there to let us in and she was great! Will def stay there again. Communication with Charl leading up to our stay was always a quick & prompt response."
11112236,91096255,2016-09-26T05:09:54Z,"How can one describe te view from this apartment ??!! Magnificent ...could spend days just sitting watching the bay.

Everything in apartment that you would ever need. The attention to detail was astounding.

11112236,87644476,2016-09-07T08:30:11Z,Charli was great - he made sure we arrived safely and had all the information we needed for our stay. The location is amazing and great views from 2 of the bedrooms and the living room.  Plus the added benefit of wifi and DSTV so if you don't want to leave the apartment you can sit and enjoy the views with everything you need. 
11112236,43248359,2016-08-30T06:31:08Z,"Charl was a good host and replied to all our inquires in good time.
The apartment was clean and well appointed and everything but one plug point was in good order. You can stay here anytime with confidence."

10827809,28073061,2017-05-06T18:07:40Z,"These hosts were very accomodating when I asked for a third friend to stay with us after a last-minute change. They breakfast in the terrace facing the Capitolio is worth every penny of the $5 CUC. The room was clean and had A/C, private bathroom. Overall, I would mainly choose this place based on the location and easy access to all the hot spots in Old Havana. Hosts were very friendly and easy to talk to. When I first arrived to this building, I was a little skeptical by the look of the place from the outside, but once you make your way to the fourth floor in the elevator and see the view of the capitolio and the apartment inside, then everything changed for the better. "
10827809,24417398,2017-05-01T13:59:18Z,"Luis and his wife live in a very unsuspecting and charming location, directly across from El capitolio in the heart of Havana! Their accommodations were fantastic, and we wished that we had stayed more than just one night with them. We were able to get to everything we needed in minutes!"
10827809,40023147,2017-04-30T17:33:40Z,"Luis, Madelyn and their son Giovanni are warm, welcoming hosts of a unique and beautiful space, centrally-located between Cerro and Old Havana, close to all of the sights and sounds. Madelyn made my family a wonderful breakfast set on the patio overlooking the Capitolio and the Gran Teatro. For lunch, one need go no further than Los Nardos, one of Havana's best restaurants, just steps down the street."
10827809,116984604,2017-04-29T15:45:33Z,"Great place to stay! Definetely to recommend! Very friendly and helpful hosts, good price and good breakfast :-) The room was big, clean and had all we needed. The location is wonderful, can walk to old town, restaurants and shops are very close. 
It was great to meet you Luis and Madelaine, thank´s again for your hospitality! And thank´s for the birthday song :-) Hope to see you again soon!"
10827809,42455115,2017-04-26T12:26:12Z,Super emplacement !
10827809,27918986,2017-04-23T15:42:26Z,"The perfect location in Havana, just opposite Capitolio, with a great view of it from the balcony. Very friendly and helpful hosts!"
10827809,23997732,2017-04-20T14:12:20Z,"Das Zimmer mit eigenem Bad war sauber, groß und mit Kühlschrank und Klimaanlage ausgestattet. Die Gastgeber waren freundlich.

Dies kann ich leider nicht von allen Kubanern sagen. Gerade in Havanna solltet ihr aufpassen, dass ihr als Touristen nicht ausgenommen werdet. Taxis haben gut 10CUC Spielraum nach unten. Insgesamt wurden wir in Havanna sehr häufig angesprochen und nach Geld gefragt. An jeder Ecke werden einem Taxis oder falsche Zigarren angeboten - da sollte man wirklich gar nicht erst drauf reagieren!
Für Havanna selbst reichen 3 Tage locker aus - der Rest Kubas hat deutlich mehr zu bieten. Der malecon war leider eher eine Enttäuschung dafür war Alt Havanna und die  Burg (welche man mit einer Fähre erreicht) wirklich schöne Erlebnisse. Allerdings auch hier lauert eine Touristenfalle. Für die Fähre reicht es, einen CUP ( die nationale Währung) zu zahlen den Touristen wird meistens 1 CUC abgenommen was umgerechnet ungefähr 24 CUP entspricht. ;)
"
10827809,67676988,2017-04-16T13:47:06Z,"Great location for exploring Havanna. Nice host, some basic Spanish will help, but we had no problems at all. I would definitely recommend it to stay there."
10827809,67891439,2017-04-13T12:43:55Z,Louis und Madelyn sind sehr herzlich. Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral am Capitolio und der Altstadt. Schönes Frühstück auf der Terrasse. Alles prima. 
10827809,97075174,2017-04-09T12:45:47Z,"esperienza  buona, Luis e sua moglie carinissimi e la posizione  dell'appartamento  è  eccezionale."
10827809,6602190,2017-03-31T15:05:04Z,You can't beat the location! Right in Old Havana and walking distance to everything! Extremely nice and helpful with everything too- definitely recommend! 
10827809,109833833,2017-03-30T14:43:25Z,"We had amazing time in La Habana. Luis and his wife were very kind, extremely helpful and it was an absolute pleasure to stay at their apartment. It was very clean, the breakfast was amazing and the view of the Capitolio was incredible. The apartment was easy to find, especially when coming from the airport with a cab. The location is great, with only walking distance to all the famous spots in Habana Vieja. We will definitely recommend your place - thanks for being a great host and your great hospitality, we really appreciate it and will always look back to an unforgettable time in Havana. Muchas gracias!"
10827809,12127899,2017-03-28T12:09:15Z,Luis and Madilyn are great hosts.  Lovely breakfast offered.  Great location and view of the capital.  They were helpful but it does help if you know Spanish!  Luis is also a taxi driver and has a very cool all original classic car.  They are warm and took car of us when we had a night that we needed accommodations the last night by finding us another place!!!
10827809,38513890,2017-03-23T14:28:09Z,"This casa is in a fabulous location, the balcony overlooks El Capitilino (most likely misspelled that). The air con was great, bed very comfortable, hosts extremely inviting! "
10827809,39633636,2017-03-21T14:13:11Z,"Logement très très bien placé! L'accès se fait par un escalier ""un peu douteux"" mais une fois la porte de l'appartement passé, tout est mignon et joliment décoré.
Une belle vue sur le capitolio et le théâtre depuis la terrasse.
La chambre est confortable et dispose de tout le confort nécessaire pour quelques jours à La Havane.
Les hôtes sont vraiment très chaleureux : très sociables et gentils. Ils nous ont même permis de laisser nos bagages dans le logement une fois la chambre libérée pour ne pas qu'ils nous encombrent en ville"
10827809,28252015,2017-03-20T12:57:48Z,"Luis and his wife were amazing hosts. They were attentive to the apartment and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. They were also well informed about Havana and made numerous suggestions for places to eat, to visit and how to get around. 

The location of the apartment can't be beat. It is directly in front of The Capitolio and just a few steps from the main Obispo street in La Habana Vieja with restaurants, shops activities. "

Geniale Aussicht
Sehr freundliche Gastgeber

Keine Sitzmöglichkeiten auf der tollen Terrasse
"
10827809,55615812,2017-03-13T12:11:20Z,Great location - it is right opposite the Capitolio so the view from their balcony was really beautiful. They were very accommodating hosts and very patient when explaining things to us since we spoke very little Spanish. The room was comfortable and very clean.
10827809,118748943,2017-03-12T14:25:33Z,"Would highly recommend this apartment.  Our hosts were friendly, gracious, and extremely helpful with anything we needed.  The room is clean and well equipped, the home is in an ideal location, walkable to all sights in Old Havana and Central Havana.  We plan on staying again on our next visit!"
10827809,110313818,2017-03-08T14:18:19Z," This apartment is directly across the street from the capital and walkable distance to many restaurants, shops and other sites to see. I felt like I had stepped back into the 1950s and loved seeing all the vintage cars driving past. The hosts were extremely  helpful in every way  and Madelyn is an excellent cook! The apartment building is old like all of Havana but their apartment is well kept. If you want a true Cuban experience stay here."
2112960,104804743,2017-05-07T09:36:10Z,"Villa Ondine is a beautiful, big villa situated at the beach of Kommetjie. The place itself is so lovely we almost didn't want to leave it to visit all the beauty of Capetown. All major attractions can be reached within 45 minutes driving. We spend 6 nights in Ondine with 3 kids of 10, 12 and 13 and managed to see a lot of the major spots while still allowing time to relax in the villa, enjoying the beach, the pool or the terrace. We got a warm welcome by Tim's father Leon who lives in a house adjacent to the villa. The sunset over the Atlantic can be viewed from the beach or terrace and in the distance you can see Hout Bay and the table mountain. The sound of the waves is ever present in the house. The place itself is very large with 2 terraces, 4 twin bedrooms and a large living/dining with open kitchen which is overlooking the atlantic. We felt at home instantaneously and will for sure be back one day."
2112960,6947015,2017-05-01T13:48:39Z,"The house is nice but some things are not acceptable. The lady who came do the cleaning didn't ring at the door she came through the garden and didn't say hello, asking us to finish quickly. same for the men with her.  after was the most that the father of the owner came at 9am (check in at 10) with people (builders) in the garden  and a big big dog who entered in the house!!!  (we have a baby of 5 weeks old who was on seat on the floor and a girl of 3 years old) they didn't say good morning (or sorry) as we were at breakfast!!  the bathroom is open view to the garden and this people came on the bathroom window when my wife was still in the shower !!! Just this feeling you are in their house! Plus for this price please put some lamp/ light on side of the beds and some shampoo/soap in the bathrooms and oil for the kitchen... the house is really nice but some things and services has to be changed for this type of prices. "
2112960,1720706,2017-04-21T07:51:49Z,We had such a fantastic stay. The house is great and the views were amazing. We felt very lucky to have stayed here and would highly recommend it. 
2112960,50071567,2017-04-16T09:59:18Z,"Tim and his parents were great hosts. We loved the house, the views, location and size it great for a large family or extended family. The only down side, is for elders walking to the beach had to bed done on the road. It's a rocky walk. 
Thanks for a wonderful stay."
2112960,42989297,2017-04-02T09:36:37Z,"Wonderful stay right on the beach. Easy check-in, well equipped home, we had a fantastic time."
2112960,7275829,2017-03-11T09:31:49Z,"The house has an incredible view and a lovely living space. We were really lucky with weather and as such could enjoy the outside space. we were 6 adults with children which meant a full house, but the space provides well for a bigger group. parking is limited for bigger groups as the owner and his parents live on the property as well. i did not read the reviews properly and missed this fact."
2112960,4625643,2017-02-27T02:38:32Z,"Wir waren 11 Tage in Tims Haus. Eine absolut traumhafte Lage mit einer tollen Aussicht. 
Das Haus ist gut ausgestattet, allerdings auch nur für 8 Personen. Die Hausangestellte Beanie ist super. Eine ganz liebe und nette Person, die täglich das Haus sauber macht und die Wäsche wäscht. 

Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit und können diese Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen.

Wir kommen bestimmt nochmal wieder.
"
2112960,107056177,2017-02-12T06:47:32Z,"The house is really beautifull and well decorated, perfectly integrated in its environment. The outside lightnings are well thinked and beautifull. The main room with its bathroom give a smashing view on the sea and is perfect for a couple Looking for romance and relaxing time. There was enough space for two couples with four kids, the living room is just huge with breathtaking view on the bay. The terrasse around the house is well made, confortable, the outside sofa is perfect for a drink while you admire the sunset on the sea.
Tim's father, Leon, was a very kind host. 

"
2112960,26382550,2017-02-08T07:24:10Z,The views are even better in person!  Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and relax after a long day of sightseeing.  We enjoyed the ability to slip down to the beach or wander to a local restaurant on foot.  And after a week on game drives we really appreciated the laundry services!
2112960,6373292,2017-02-03T07:33:13Z,"Absolutely beautiful house with a well-equipped kitchen, gorgeous view and wonderful outdoor spaces.  Our hosts were gracious and available (they live in the flat on the property).  The only thing we'd mention is that the beach there is full of kelp so that the beach you walk out onto isn't really walkable, and the kelp is rotting so it produces a very strong odor that some mornings (depending on the way the wind blew) was quite strong.  If you're looking for the view and the space, we'd HIGHLY recommend it.  If the beach is key, keep in the mind that you'll need to still drive to a swim-able beach."
2112960,29117309,2017-01-26T06:14:25Z,"Amazing beach house with stunning sea views and wide set up. The kids loved the pool and we could not get over how close we where to the sea. We really loved. Its a great hide away and still close to Cape Town, the Wine lands, Houtbaai, Noordhoek, Cape Point & Chapman's peak. We spend the last week of a 5 week trip to SA here and it was the best end of our holiday's we could wish for. Both Tim & Leon where very helpful. The house comes with a housekeeper which is a great service to have. "
2112960,3489076,2017-01-21T08:47:23Z,"Tim's place is a really special hideaway in the understated gem of a village called Konnetjie. It is close to local shops, beaches and walks yet tucked away so that all you have in front of you is the spectacular view of the bay. We loved chilling out here on our last few days in Cape Town before heading home. "
2112960,73506765,2017-01-16T09:49:03Z,Outstanding views and superb location!
2112960,10221127,2017-01-08T02:20:38Z,"Best view ever! 

We spend 2 weeks in Tims house over Christmas and it was a perfect holiday for me and my family. 

The house offers much more space than we expected from the pictures. Tims brother Josh was there to welcome us and we could contact him with any questions.

Beanie (housekeeping) and Brooks (gardener) delivered excellent service.

We will definitely come back."
2112960,16036225,2016-10-22T01:19:10Z,"Beautiful place, we loved every single moment we spent there.
Unique location with stunning views. We're so happy to know that there is this lovely beach house where we definitively want to go back."
2112960,85341947,2016-10-03T09:16:46Z,"I enjoyed every bit of my 30th birthday celebrations. Tim is a wonderful no fuss host. He is friendly, well mannered and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure you and your guests are comfortable."
2112960,15080646,2016-09-22T06:12:10Z,"INCREDIBLE! We spent the last 3 nights of our month-long vacation at Villa Ondine and couldn't be happier. Right on the beach with incredible views, super spacious, wonderfully appointed and even came with a housekeeper, Penny, who washed our clothes and cleaned up after us. There were only 2 of us in this giant house and we are DEFINITELY coming back with friends!"
2112960,61491558,2016-08-30T00:06:52Z,We had a wonderful time. The place is beautiful and we'll looked after. 
2112960,55725929,2016-08-22T00:37:41Z,"Villa Ondine helped provide a fantastic finish to our best family vacation yet.  This is a beautiful property in a great beach community.  The service (grounds keeper/property manager and housekeeper) team really took care of us.

We were very pleased!  It's a great choice!"
2112960,15389942,2016-08-18T03:47:55Z,"Nous avons chaleureusement été accueilli par le père de Tim. Les deux bouteilles de vin en cadeau de bienvenue ont été appréciées. 2 personnels de maison sont à disposition. Ils sont très gentils et communicatifs. Nous avons pu faire laver tout notre linge ( c'est compris dans le prix de la location ), ceci est fortement appréciable après 10 jours dans le nord. La maison est tout à fait conforme aux photos. La vue est incroyable. Le feu de cheminée à tourné à plein aussi bien pour son charme que pour réchauffer la pièce principale en cette période hivernale fraîche la nuit. La chambre parental côté jardin à un chauffage au sol très appréciable. Pas de chauffage par contre pour les trois autres pièces, mais c'est supportable. La plage est à 200 mètres avec un spot de surf à mi-chemin. Spectacle garantit tôt le matin ou en fin d'après midi par lessurfeurs. La maison dispose d'une alarme relié à un central qui rassure vraiment si besoin avec une intervention stres rapide, mais le quartier est très paisible. Une petite supérette à moins d'un kilomètre ainsi que quelques restaurant si besoin.
Nous aurions bien utilisé la piscine mais elle était en renovation, une fois finie, je vos garantis un resultat magnifique. J'en suis dja jaloux !"
1877613,21577637,2017-05-02T07:38:21Z,"We had a lovely stay at the apartment. Its quite central ,walking distance to the V&A waterfront and other places. The woolworth supermarket very closeby as well as excellent restaurants. We loved the view from the apartments. We wont hesistate to come again and stay here. It was ideal for our family."
1877613,120493227,2017-04-28T06:53:13Z,The apartment was clean and very comfortable. Very nice kitchen and the apartment is situated in a great area.

1877613,85238239,2017-04-14T06:14:52Z,"We had the great pleasure to have our family reunion at Ross's apartment- a very homely , scenic, beautiful , spotlessly clean apartment. Excellent views of the VA Waterfront and Table Mountain and very easy access to public transport. Ross is an excellent host; quick response to all messages and he gave me a call a few hours before check in, the whole process was very smooth . I will certainly be back again and would recommend this apartment to anyone visiting The Mother City - Cape Town "
1877613,15925381,2017-04-09T08:24:06Z,"This is a beautiful apartment in a centrally located neighbourhood. We felt like we were in a boutique hotel. The only problem was that the communications with Ross were not overly streamlined (he did not always answer our texts) and could be improved. This would have made our stay nicer, as there was a problem with the tv and wifi that we had to figure out on our own.
"
1877613,87238982,2017-03-30T08:08:34Z,"Very nice place. In front of Waterfront. Clean and bright
"
1877613,25155825,2017-03-21T08:17:23Z,This apartment is in a great location and  has fabulous views toward the stadium and V&A waterfront.  The staff in the building were really helpful as well.  We found everything we needed in the apartment and the beds were really cofortable.  The apartment is beautifully  decorated and with some minor baby proofing our 17 month old could run around no worries.  We did at times find it difficult to contact our host but other then that it was a great stay and we would choose to stay here again.
1877613,47276610,2017-03-17T06:17:00Z,"We had an amazing 3 night stay! The apartment is beautiful with wonderful views, is close to the waterfront and surrounded by lots of nice eateries. We would definitely recommend to friends and hope to come back!"
1877613,7552292,2017-01-07T01:32:26Z,Very comfortable apartment perfected located and within walking distance of the V&A.  Spotless and equipped with all you could need for a wonderfully relaxing vacation.  Great value and I would highly recommend.

1877613,60169116,2016-12-14T06:08:18Z,"What you see is what you get!!!  The apartment was just as it looks in the pictures.  My husband and our friends loved the place and would recommend it to anyone travelling to Cape Town any time. It is well situated, accessible to the CBD, to the V&A Waterfront, to the Green Point Stadium and to several restaurants and bars on foot or if too tired a quick 3 minute cab drive.  The security guards at the entrance were friendly and helpful, so was the cleaning lady (Thembile I think her name was) who checked us in and out of the apartment.  The view from the apartment was breathtaking too, facing the table mountain, waterfront and the stadium.  We had a perfect holiday because we had a perfect place to stay.

1963643,89280818,2017-02-24T06:44:24Z,"Julie & Karen are superb hosts. They are very quick to respond to any queries and will happily assist you with any questions you may have regarding exploring Seoul.

1963643,40260013,2017-01-17T23:27:48Z,"Karen's place was a nice little apartment which was perfect for me and my partner.  There are decent restaurants and cafes in walking distance, and Chungmu-ro train station is right in the front.  We loved the great view through the big window in the apartment.  Waking up looking at the snow falling from the sky and the beautiful night of Seoul.  Amazing!!"
1963643,29277790,2017-01-02T02:50:33Z,"Julie and Karen's apartment was very clean, comfortable, and in an excellent location.  Right next to the subway line 4 which can get you anywhere in the city.  However, we never saw the portable wi-fi egg as promised in the description and it took the host nearly 10 hours to respond when I inquired about it.  Still a good experience nonetheless. "
1963643,23696726,2016-12-22T11:17:23Z,Great place to stay. Easy and fast coordination with the owners and convenient location for travellers.
1963643,23104474,2016-11-27T02:32:57Z,"Apartment is very central to Myeong-dong. Also walking distance to Chungmuro underground station. The apartment was clean, modern and spacious. Please note there are at least two lifts to get up to the floor for this apartment. One of the lifts is behind a closed door. Host was very responsive in communicating. There is a very good local restaurant next to convenient store in front of this block of apartments. They are really good for Korean soup for breakfast and lunch and also do Korean BBQ for dinner."
1963643,103763144,2016-11-21T23:21:03Z,"房子跟照片呈现的一样,特别干净,距离明洞走路10来分钟,房东人也很热情,下次来一定还住这里~"

1963643,26452361,2016-11-12T10:52:19Z,"Good location to stay at! Convenient to go about most tourist attractions. Direction to the house was very clear as given by the host. Karen took her time off to visit us on our first day and made sure everything is good for our stay. Helpful and friendly. Fuss-free, no problem at all! "
1963643,29620088,2016-11-03T00:02:31Z,"호스트를 만나지는 못했지만 너무 친절하게 알려주시고 저희 일정에 맞게 도와주셨습니다. 
숙소는 두말할것도 없이 편안하고 내 집같고 무엇보다 위치가 너무 좋았습니다. 
다음번에 한국에 방문할께 꼭 다시 오고십네요!
강력 추천해요!"
1963643,49580276,2016-10-31T11:19:26Z,"The location of the apartment was amazing! The train station is connected to both orange and blue lines, so it was easy to get to any part in Seoul. Karen was great host and also quick to respond to any questions we had, she also helped us order food delivery to the house. The neighbourhood is quiet despite being near to Myeongdong shopping district, there were many convenience stores, cafes and restaurants around, so it was certain we will never be hungry. The Wi-fi portable egg that Karen provided us really helped us throughout our stay in Seoul, it even had connection in the underground train! This way it really helped us navigate through Seoul. If we do come back to Seoul again, we will definitely come back and stay at Karen's apartment!!"
1963643,30528552,2016-10-19T03:06:12Z,"Before my travel, I was briefed about the stay and how to get there. Very informative and it gives the assurance that my trip has been looked into and prepared for our arrival. Karen was able to keep me posted whenever I communicated with her. Will highly recommend my friends who are looking for Airbnb in Myeondong."
1963643,6185548,2016-10-12T08:54:29Z,"Nice little apartment in a very good location, close to train station, airport bus stop, convenience store and restaurants.

I had a great stay."
1963643,13663923,2016-09-26T06:31:56Z,"Karen and Julie's apartment was great! The apartment is just like the pictures, very clean, bright, and with stunning views of Seoul Tower. The location is ideal for visiting the Myeongdong area. Very close to great restaurants and shopping. It is also very close to the metro which makes is a great base from to tour around town from and view the entire city. Karen was very communicative throughout our stay. Would love to visit again some day."
1963643,2983689,2016-09-23T06:26:26Z,"Great place to stay,  easy access to public transport which gets you to all the major tourist attractions in Seoul. Host is very helpful and place is kept clean and tidy with easy instructions  to follow. Oh yes the view of N Seoul tower is worth it!"

Bus service is not available around the area, about 30 minutes walk to city central but there are bicycles provided by the host (FOC) for guests to use. There is a 24 hours grocery mart around the area, about 10 mins walk from the apartment. Qing is very kind and helpful in arranging day tours and taxi during our stay in Hualien but you might want to consider tour packages available in Taobao as well. "

10908370,37408149,2017-05-06T13:00:34Z,"We cannot say enough good things about this hostal and its hosts.  They were incredibly helpful and kind throughout our stay and went out of their way to provide us with everything we needed.  We highly recommend eating breakfast and dinner at the hostal - the quality of the food and the presentation is very upscale for a very affordable price. We had fresh caught fish for dinner that was incredible.  The hostal is well situated to the city center and is in a quiet, safe area.  We will definitely come back when we return to Trinidad."
10908370,9961151,2017-05-04T18:32:41Z,"Tudo perfeito: novinho, limpo, café da manhã completo e delicioso, família super simpática e acolhedora. A casa não é do lado do centro, mas a cidade é uma graça e vale os 15 min de caminhada. Além de tudo, o Pepe é um cozinheiro de mão cheia! Super recomendo."
10908370,2457092,2017-05-01T15:10:20Z,"Pepe's home was a dream! Beautifully decorated and spacious (the entire top floor is reserved just for you and your fellow guests). You'll also have access to the outside deck where you can enjoy a late night drink and breakfast al fresco. We truly fell in love with Pepe's home and are already planning on booking it when we return for an extended stay. The only thing to note is that it is a bit of a distance from the main square, about 12-20 minutes depending on walking speed. Thanks again for hosting us, Pepe! "
10908370,13340186,2017-04-30T12:43:20Z,"Abitazione di Lusso! Persone cordiali e molto istruite.
Siamo stati trattati da Re!
Consiglio di cenare presso l'abitazione e non cenare nei ristoranti di Trinidad, la cena nell'abitazione del prof. Pepe è divina, soprattutto l'aragosta!
Consigliatissima!!!"
10908370,40225288,2017-04-28T14:37:14Z,"Penso sia la migliore allocazione che si possa scegliere. spaziosa su una strada che di notte è illuminata ma silenziosa, due bagni e una cucina enorme.ambiente climatizzato perfettamente"
10908370,87579220,2017-04-27T13:43:01Z,What a wonderful Casa! The staff and apartment are perfect. The best Casa we stayed at in Cuba. The photos do not do the place justice it is an absolute haven and a pleasure to return home to after a busy day out. The food is sublime that they prepare for you. Highly recommend 
10908370,7389744,2017-04-24T14:30:02Z,"We absolutely LOVED Jose's place. The location was perfect - a nice 10-15 minute stroll to the city center, but in a quiet residential-like area off a main road. The apartment was beautifully decorated and designed - bid windows that open to let light and air in. Jose was incredibly nice and welcoming, and he answered any questions that we had. Would highly recommend staying here and would come back ourselves!"
10908370,3018059,2017-04-19T13:15:42Z,"You  will be very surprised at how brand new/modern the entire apartment is. Fully equipped kitchen, big dining room table, a veranda for breakfast, what more could you want. It is a fair walking distance to the colonial part of Trinidad and the bus station but a pedicab is usually readily available. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants near the home but went to one right across from the Viazul bus station that was very inexpensive and had good food. It was handy to have beer and water available in the refrigerator for purchase. "
10908370,29020014,2017-04-17T12:50:27Z,"Mejor imposible, muy buen servicio, muy buena casa, moderna, de calidad, todo perfecto con todas las comodidades."
10908370,13481062,2017-04-15T12:31:18Z,"Besides some communication problem we had for getting the exact address who made us loose at least an hour after a long trip , going around the town with our luggages .. we had the perfect time. Getting finally to this beautiful casa, being welcomed with great cocktails made up for it ! Pepe's casa is more like a boutique hotel than a casa particular! Every thing is absolutely beautiful and modern made with great taste ! The meals as well were absolutely exquisite and generous ! Pepe and his family are warm and helpful and make you feel real welcome and give you great tips for things to do around town. They even found us a great taxi to. Cayo Coco for a really good price . In other words we highly recommended this place ! "
10908370,95299483,2017-04-14T15:39:49Z,"In der besonderen Stadt Trinidad hatten wir eine wunderbare Zeit in diesem Apartment. Alles ist genau so wie auf den Fotos zu sehen (vor Ort ist es eigentlich noch schöner). Geräumig, supersauber, ansprechend. Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt. Auf der überdachten Terrasse haben wir zum Frühstück und einmal zum Abendessen gesessen. In den Schaukelstühlen auf dem unüberdachten Teil haben wir am Abend entspannt. Das Frühstück ist empfehlenswert, alles hat wirklich gut geschmeckt, war reichlich und schön angerichtet. Das Abendessen war super lecker. Die Atmosphäre auf der beleuchteten Terrasse, das tolle Geschirr, die sooo freundliche Bewirtung - das beste Abendessen unserer Rundreise. Die historische Altstadt ist fußläufig in 15-20 Minuten gut zu erreichen. Auf dem Weg ist auch ein WiFi-Park mit gutem Empfang. Unser Auto stand sicher vor der Tür. Neben all diesen Vorzügen war es für uns sehr wertvoll, dass wir uns ehrlich willkommen gefühlt haben. Pepe stand uns mit Rat und Tat zur Seite, man konnte alles fragen. Ich kann einen Aufenthalt nur wärmstens empfehlen!!"
10908370,34230447,2017-04-10T15:39:37Z,The place was great. Pepe is a great chef and a great host. The place was very clean and the service was amazing. The house was decorated beautifully and the beds were very comftorable. We had a great time talking with them and we felt like family. 
10908370,29779767,2017-04-07T15:06:51Z,This is a beautiful one bedroom apartment on a second floor of a renovated house about a 10-15 minute walk from the center of Trinidad. Check in a breeze.  Bedroom well air-conditioned with comfortable beds and great linen.  Full kitchen completely renovated with great appliances. Front balcony and beautiful open back terrace with seating area and table to eat. Excellent breakfast for 5 CUC's.  Loved talking to Jose and his assistant who was so sweet. We highly recommend  this beautiful casa.
10908370,19860342,2017-04-05T12:32:59Z,"Amazing apartment in a great location, nice walk to all main sites but in really nice residential area, quiet and safe. Great breakfast, would visit again x"
10908370,73334789,2017-04-02T15:47:17Z,A beautiful place that is managed by beautiful people . Pepe and his help manages to keep a warm friendly touch to this authentic house in Trinidad . A welcome local drink to kick off the day and he even helped arrange taxis and salsa dancing lessons

Alles top"
10908370,119802186,2017-03-30T14:39:05Z,"Mi Esposo y yo nos encantó nuestra estancia en Trinidad en la casa de Pepe! The host was incredibly welcoming and helpful in acquainting us with Trinidad and his home was updated, clean, and in a perfect location to explore Trinidad! We would absolutely love to visit again and stay with Pepe!"
10908370,28872987,2017-03-29T13:27:47Z,"This house was fly! I really liked it. The service was outstanding and the food both breakfast (5 CUC) and dinner (10 CUC) was well worth it. You most definitely get what you pay for. The father of the family is really nice and great to talk to and the young lady who helped with the cooking and keeping of the house was good. The owner/son stopped by on our first day and chatted with us for a bit, explaining to us where to hang, house rules, etc. He was easy to talk to as well, but was on his way after that. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would stay here again. "
10908370,66420959,2017-03-27T14:26:15Z,"La casa es magnífica, incluso mejor que en fotos. El anfitrión estupendo, fue el mejor alojamiento que encontramos en toda Cuba !!!"
6042524,37650116,2017-04-23T14:40:25Z,Emmanuelle est formidable très bon week end passé sur Paris ! Je vous le conseil sincèrement ! 
6042524,80801702,2017-04-23T09:38:12Z,"This is a lovely flat in an excellent location.  It was perfect for our family (my wife and me, and our 12-year-old daughter and 10-year old son).  There's easy access to the Metropolitan and a short stroll gets you to Notre Dame, the Louvre, and other central Paris locations.  The neighborhood has everything you need (bakeries, grocery stores, dining, shopping, etc.).  This is definitely a CITY location; there is typical city noise at night from the establishments below and around the flat, but it did not disrupt our sleep.  Emma was a great hostess; she was quick to respond to questions before and during our stay.  We would definitely stay at this flat again."
6042524,72310352,2017-04-18T04:36:55Z,"It was a beutiful place in the heart of Paris. Emma was very friendly and very communicative from the beginning. The flat is truely like on the pictures. Every important and beautiful places are in walk distance (if u dont mind to walk max an hour). There were also an underground station just in 2 minutes from the flet. I foud very nice that she let a few capsule for the caffe machine, and everybody can use the guide nootbok from Emma, there are many good ideas like restaurants, supermarkets, pastry shops etc. We truely recommend for everybody who likes to go in Paris, and would like to have a super Host!!"
6042524,55250913,2017-04-13T09:47:14Z,"This flat was really special, the Location is perfect, it's so beautiful inside and out. 2 min to metro, loads of great eating spots downstairs. Pub downstairs has chatter/laughter noise we liked this but get earplugs if you need silence. Emma and tess are extremely kind and accommodating, we brought our 4 year old and 13 year old and both very happy, the main complaint was having to leave. "
6042524,101220004,2017-04-07T09:10:55Z,The location can't be faulted for ease of getting around. It's in a lovely vibrant neighbourhood. I highlybrecommend trying the second bakery in Emmanuelle's grey book.
6042524,21620630,2017-04-02T08:41:48Z,"Logement très agréable, propre et fonctionnel, situé au cœur de Paris, dans un quartier piéton et très vivant à proximité des commerces et restaurants. Idéal pour découvrir Paris... 
Moins recommandé pour les dormeurs car au dessus d'une place très sympa et très animée (bruits)"
6042524,53622192,2017-03-20T09:11:37Z,We loved staying here! Emma was so helpful and accommodating. The location is great for walking around and there are lots of good restaurants close by.
6042524,57323022,2017-03-18T07:07:34Z,"The place is absolutely beautiful and Emmanuelle is such a sweet, helpful host. Loved how comfortable the beds were and how cozy the home felt. One downside is that it was very difficult to get our luggage up the stairs. I would also suggest not driving!! Having a car especially in this area is extremely inconvenient and expensive. "
6042524,93143946,2017-03-12T02:27:22Z,"A estadia foi ótima! Localização perfeita, perto de tudo. A vizinhança é um pouco barulhenta no sábado mas não chegou a nos incomodar. As instruções de Emma são precisas (leiam o notebook que fica na cozinha). O apartamento tem tudo o necessário. "
6042524,27147812,2017-03-02T10:11:41Z,Wonderful apartment and fantastic host. The location could not have been better. Walking distance from everything with multiple public transportation options. The flat was comfortable and as beautiful as shown in the pictures. We will be back for sure.
6042524,30743054,2017-02-22T03:13:25Z,"Emmanuelle's place is a delightful and convenient apartment that provided us with a perfect launching place to explore beautiful Paris. It is so close to the heart of the city with its many tourist attractions, as well as cafes, restaurants, shops, and transport. Its situation on the edge of a plaza surrounded by cafes provides a pleasant ambient noise that added to our enjoyment. The sitting room with its large window/door that opens above this plaza is a very enjoyable room - if you don't want to be out exploring for some reason. Emmanuelle was fantastic in her communication and instructions, and the welcome provided was exceptional. "
6042524,7269000,2017-02-15T08:58:37Z,"A fantastic and spacious place to stay in Paris - you really feel at home.

The location is unbeatable; we could walk almost everywhere. It's super central so bars in the square stay open late so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.

Check-in and out was really simple and hassle-free.

Would highly recommend and plan to return!"
6042524,31051452,2017-02-11T07:43:02Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Emmanuelle's place. Things to keep in mind if you were looking to book this property:
Pros:
-close to train station (2 min walk)
- close to so many shops, restaurants, boulangeries, The Louvre, Notre Dame and major shopping districts. 
- the convenience of a kitchen and washing mashine

Cons:
- very loud and noisy neighbourhood (lots of pubs that stay open till late)
- matress wouldn't be suitable if you have back problems (very firm)"
6042524,59391628,2017-02-06T01:45:04Z,"Lovely, Lovely, Lovely! We throughly enjoyed our stay at Emma's apartment. Cozy, stylish, with everything you need to feel at home, and walk anywhere in central Paris. We plan to come back to Paris in 2018, and Emma's place is where we'd love to stay. "
6042524,30672741,2017-01-29T07:58:01Z,"It is really nice place in center of Paris! Host is really kind and everything was perfect!! She let us put our stuffs before check in and after check out:)But the problem is the place is really noisy in the midnight:( There is a lots of bars at the first floor and every night and midnight people drink and yelling....Couldn't sleep well.... except that everything was good. 

숙소가 위치가 진짜 좋구 호스트도 너무 친절한데문재는 너무 시끄럽다는 거에요. 아래층에 술집들이 많은데 매일 새벽까지 이야기 하는 소리 소리지르는 소리가 너무 크게 들려서 잠을 잘수가 없더라구요.. 그것만 빼고는 너무 좋았어요! 일찍 도착해서 짐 맡기구 나중에 체크아웃 후에도 짐 맡길 수 있게 해줬구요~ 인테리어도 너무 예뻤는데 시끄럽다는게 정말 큰 단점이에요 "
6042524,20555088,2017-01-27T10:20:45Z,"Cosy studio, located very centrally in a lively area, close to most attractions. Very good communication with hosts, and they are flexible. Also very child friendly. Perfect for a family city trip in Paris."
6042524,85579075,2017-01-26T02:06:18Z,"Great location, beautifully decorated and clean flat, easy check-in and communication with host when required. Would definitely stay again when in Paris "
6042524,74241272,2017-01-17T08:09:04Z,"This is a beautiful apartment, in a wonderful location, with a fabulous host.  Absolutely no complaints, we loved everything about this place! Thanks Emmanuelle!"
6042524,6086452,2017-01-08T01:32:24Z,"The apartment is in a fantastic location, close to subway station for easy access to Gare du Nord and Charles de Gaulle. It was extremely close to Les Halles shopping centre and walking distance to Notre Dame and the Louve. Lots of bars and restaurant ts close by. The only downside was that there is a bar directly outside so the evenings were a little bit noisy. The apartment is in a beautiful old building on the second floor and was perfect for a city break. I would reccomend this property. "
6042524,5353474,2017-01-02T04:43:25Z,The flat was in a great location in the center of Paris with different metro/RER stations nearby. Great places to eat nearby. The flat was comfortable. Thank you for allowing the early checkin and allowing us to store out bags in the laundry room until our departure. Definitely recommend this place! 
9427558,92105052,2017-05-07T07:09:19Z,Great place with great hosts will definitely stay there again
9427558,27883403,2017-05-04T13:16:45Z,"We had an amazing time here. The place really felt like home. The neighbourhood is great, everything you need is nearby. We are def going back here some day! "
9427558,46572033,2017-04-28T06:18:39Z,This was the best Airbnb we've ever stayed in! Such a unique space with an awesome deck and view of table mountain and the water. Could not have been happier. It was a great location too. 
9427558,49521089,2017-04-21T07:56:51Z,"amazing home!  we enjoyed the splendid location were your walkings distance away from great restaurants.  also, your 10-15 min from table top and lions head! do not miss out, book a night now."
9427558,18804004,2017-04-17T09:53:52Z,"We loved this apartment. So much so that we wish we had stayed longer. Everything you need for your stay is provided, from some lovely hot cross buns (it was Easter), butter, eggs and milk in the fridge. There was also eveything you needed to cook with, which we did a lot of as the place was so homely.  Heather also offered us the use of her bikes during our stay. If we are ever back in Cape Town we would definitely look into booking this apartment again. "
9427558,93709422,2017-04-03T08:18:21Z,"We've spent 4 nights in Cape night and have very much appreciated our stay at the nice and comfortable studio of Hearther and Niels.
They have been very freindly and helpful.
The apartement is fully equipped and has a beautiful terrace. 
We recommend it!!"
9427558,17937816,2017-03-25T09:56:17Z,"I loved the place, as advertised, very roomy and every enquiry was dealt with quickly by Heather. The suggested food places were great and the little personalised book of instructions is a great idea. Well done!"
9427558,6251572,2017-03-18T08:35:36Z,"Heather's apartment was beyond my expectations...This place is filled with love and light. Everything is as described if not more...we loved having our breakfast on the terrace every morning and to have surprise visits by our neighbors the cats (Nutmeg and Allan, we miss you already!). Heather made everything so our stay is as comfortable as possible. Can't recommend it enough!! Will be back for sure!"
9427558,94458562,2017-03-11T07:36:14Z,"We had a great time in the apartment. Heather and Nils gave us a warm welcome and a perfect food starter kid in the fridge. The apartment was very beautiful, just in the middle of Cape Town. The communication was always friendly. We can recommend this apartment anytime!"
9427558,77821382,2017-03-04T07:19:00Z,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying in Heather's flat. Communication was very(!) well and the welcoming was just amazing. Heather greeted us with a bottle of wine and some bread and there were even eggs for breakfast. The roofterrace is just beautiful and even if the restaurants in the area are very nice, we stayed in two nights, to enjoy the privacy of the terrace. "
9427558,775619,2017-02-23T07:35:24Z,"Notre séjour chez Heather et Niels s'est déroulé avec perfection. L'appartement est superbe : très bien situé, décoré avec goût et équipé avec tout le nécessaire. La mention spéciale pour le toit terrasse où nous avons passé les soirées à se relaxer ! Le quartier est très sympa : de belles maisons, restaurants et petits commerces à proximité. Une valeur sûre ! Nous recommandons vivement. Merci à Heather et Niels pour leur accueil chaleureux. "
9427558,11279740,2017-02-20T07:13:51Z,"My boyfriend and I had the best time staying at Heather's home. It was a wonderful experience and we were very sad to leave. 
The house itself was amazing, so spacious and really felt like home. The deck which had incredible views of Table Mountain was our favourite and it was a perfect spot to enjoy some sundowners. The kitchen was equipped with everything you needed for cooking, and they even left us wine, eggs and bread. 
Heather and Niels were so friendly and
Hospitable, and really went out of their way to ensure we felt comfortable. 
De Waterkant is a great neighbourhood, with lots of restaurants and bars and also close to all that Cape Town has to offer. 
We can't recommend Heather and Niel's place strongly enough, and hopefully we will be back! "
9427558,938603,2017-02-16T09:17:11Z,"Actually it was already our second stay at Heather and Niels´ apartment and we feel at home away from home. It´s always a pleasure to stay in this cosy apartment which is really well located, safe and in the nice area ""de waterkant"". Everything you need, you can find in walking distance, which is very convenient. It´s a great place to discover Capetown and it´s surroundings from. Hosts Heather and Niels are not only very correct but also helpful and utterly nice people. They will go out of their way to make your stay very pleasurable. The apartment is very cosy and offers a really nice big roof terrace with views of the harbor. The apartment is well equiped and is cleaned on a weekly base.
To be recommended!!"
9427558,5471996,2017-01-08T01:53:26Z,"Heather's place is just outstanding! Although she could not welcome us in person, her friend welcomed us as warmly as possible with a lot of tips, some wine, bread and everything else you need when you arrive. 

The apartment offers everything you need and more. We always felt very comfortable and enjoyed every single minute of our stay. It has an very cosy, creative atmosphere and offers a lot of space. After three weeks at the apartment, we felt like leaving our own home. The kitchen is equipped very well with upmarket cooking utensils, a big oven and stove. Also the bathroom/ wardrobe is very spacious with two sinks and it is clean. The sleeping area with its huge and comfortable bed invites for sweet dreams and a peaceful sleep. Although the sleeping area is situated directly under the roof, we never felt hot during the nights. The place also offers a closed parking space, which is a big plus. The highlight of the place, is the huge deck, where you can chill out, enjoy the sun, have breakfast during sunrise or have typical South African braais with your friends (which you definitely should not miss during your stay). It has a beautiful view at the sea and table mountain.

The area is vibrant, colourful and offers a large selection of cafes (Charles Cafe, Origin, The Village Cafe) bars (Manhattan, The Sky Bar, The Piano Bar) and shops. All of them are just a few steps away from the apartment. You always feel save and secure and can walk around by foot. Close to the apartment is the shopping Center Cape Quarter, which offers a lot of shopping possillities as well.

Heather is definitely a super host. Already before our arrival we stayed in contact and she arranged everything according to our wishes and always offered her help, if we would have needed anything. She replied to our messages very quickly.  She was always there if we needed her and did her very best to make our stay unforgettable. She is a lovely, very friendly, helpful, open minded and thoughtful person, who is always around, if you need a hand. But still you always enjoy your privacy, if you want to. She knew that we celebrate Christmas with our family and friends at the apartment. So she surprised us with a lovely Christmas tree full of chocolate. Since we got married during our stay, we had a lot of friends around, which was never a problem for her. She even supported us and helped us whenever and wherever she could.  

We are very thankful for staying with Heather and we will come back for sure. We have been to South Africa/ Cape Town already a couple of times and we have never stayed at such a perfect place with such a lovely host before. So for all the  people who, are looking after a place to stay in Cape Town, Heather's place is absolutely the perfect choice."
9427558,78565559,2016-12-05T08:25:46Z,"Absolutely perfect! The hosts were hospitable, kind, and extremely helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone who comes to Cape Town. "
9427558,19555007,2016-11-30T06:54:06Z,"I was greeted as an old friend, it was so lovely and welcoming.  I felt like I found a gem and don't want to share it!! 
My greatest regret was leaving. 
"
9427558,1133090,2016-11-26T03:20:19Z,"Absolutely loved the place! Everything was perfect, especially the terrace. Neighborhood was great, lots of restaurants, cafes and bars in walking distance. Would absolutely recommend the place "
9427558,1005725,2016-11-17T07:46:17Z,"What a place! Heather and Niels are wonderful host who will do anything to make you feel at home. Everything went so smoothly and uncomplicated... 
The area is one of the nicest in Cape Town, with everything you need in walking distance. 
This is a great place, especially for couples and friends. Absolutely nothing to complain about! 
Go for it :)"
9427558,81857425,2016-11-13T00:57:11Z,"Fantastic apartment, everything we expected and more. Super central and close the great shops, restaurants and more. Heather was a great host, made our trip down to Cape Town extra special. "
9427558,1706651,2016-11-05T00:37:47Z,"Niels was very helpful when I arrived. He helped me to rent a scooter. The fridge was stocked with milk, eggs and a bottle of wine. Very thoughtful of Niels and Heather."
8910216,81780918,2017-05-05T06:21:49Z,虽然是下雨天 不过抽湿器帮了大忙 房间里没有潮潮的感觉 老房子隔音稍差 不过沙发很舒服 卧室里的黑胶机很有情调 房东沟通超级及时迅速 希望以后有机会能住别的房间
8910216,63595738,2017-05-01T03:20:29Z,"房间小小的,但是很可爱。附近特别适合散步溜达,还有很多有趣的店铺。房东很nice."
8910216,109435852,2017-04-27T06:04:50Z,"地方离地铁站很近,去周围也很方便。住的区域是比较安静的,就是晚上车的声音很大,房东备的有耳塞,好在后面几天白天太累,晚上睡觉没受大影响。房东随时沟通交流很顺畅,没有那种收费后就不想做后续服务的感觉。第一次订民宿,多交一个朋友,挺好的。投影仪给孩子看电视比较好,有洗衣机也能随时给孩子洗干净衣服比较方便。"
8910216,51049841,2017-04-22T01:11:24Z,"房东十分热情,提供的入住攻略十分详细。房屋所在的位置方便交通出行,离地铁站仅七八分钟路程,房间内设施齐全,温馨感满满,屋外的秋千也十分可爱,推荐入住。"
8910216,29323217,2017-04-17T02:17:39Z,"位置方便,不過就是隔壁聲音聽得很清楚。沒有耳罩"
8910216,119205613,2017-04-12T03:36:26Z,地理位置真的超方便 打车步行骑单车都可以 可惜住的那几天下雨 没能在院子里坐一下 有机会再去试试别的房型
8910216,121624782,2017-04-10T02:14:47Z,"诚实的说一些优缺点
优点:1 地段不错,位置好找,离地铁10号线上海图书馆站3号口很近,交通方便,离武康路等文艺路近,适合步行走走。2 房子虽小,设备设施比较齐全,热水,地暖,马桶等不错,大屏幕很好用,屋内装饰明显是用了心的,外面的小院子虽然没有使用,但是看着也是赏心悦目。

缺点:1 由于是老房子,隔音非常不好,不仅能清楚地听到外面车辆经过的很大声音,在一层还能感觉到地铁经过,即使房主准备了耳塞,毕竟不会完全阻挡噪音,对于睡眠环境要求高,喜欢安静的人不推荐。2 房子地段虽好,但是周边环境一般,房子要走几十米非常隐蔽的小路,晚上没有路灯,很黑。房间里有些小细节可以改进,比如有些地方比较老旧粗糙,床垫会有声音等等。
总体来说,还算比较满意,谢谢房主miumiu提供的房子。"
8910216,119429060,2017-04-08T00:57:53Z,"看中小花园和地理位置,这两点来说达到预期。老房子总会有些小问题,房东很好,积极解决,非常感谢!房间不大,能做到五脏俱全还很现代化绝对是用心的!"
8910216,46988998,2017-03-28T02:00:29Z,"环境很棒!有小家的感觉。院子很美,屋内设施齐全。交通也很便利,没几分钟可以到便利店以及十号线。旁边的餐厅也很棒,感谢房东推荐!除了隔音不是很好晚上睡觉有些困扰以外都很好,而且房东很贴心准备了耳塞!很有心意。入住体验五颗星~非常推荐哦!"
8910216,30893665,2017-03-25T01:50:17Z,"miumiu的小森林地段不错,靠近淮海中路那一片,适合外出随意逛逛~一直觉得淮海中路是上海最美的一条路~房子虽然小,但是装饰得很精致文艺,收拾得也干净,要是地暖再暖一点就好啦!anyway,谢谢miumiu热情推荐给我附近的餐厅,那附近真的很多值得一吃的餐厅!"
8910216,41551143,2017-03-21T00:38:33Z,"跟闺蜜一起找,很快就找到了,信息十分准确,从上海图书馆地铁站出来走五分钟就到啦,而且这个站这条线很方便去火车站和两个机场~第一天就在小森林宅了大半天,一进去就不想出门啦^ - ^ 来的时候都是下雨天,只要不开门窗就不会冷了,我们没有开地暖也OK。跟闺蜜约好了下次再来上海一定要住住看miumiu其他的房源!"
8910216,28803314,2017-03-19T00:41:00Z,"非常好非常好的位置,离武康路很近,走路去徐家汇也不远,推荐去看看上海的老建筑。"
8910216,69712090,2017-03-16T00:49:46Z,"It is a wonderful place for a solo traveller, small but fully equipped, centrally located with walking distance to subway stations, the bed is comfy and the little garden is indeed the high light. 
Miumiu is a kind and responsive host, I'd be interested in trying her other places. "
8910216,89611634,2017-03-08T00:40:55Z,"小森林和名字一样 给人一种静谧舒适的感觉 在上海的四天真的很舒服 安安静静的小弄堂 和闺蜜都非常的喜欢 。小森林的地址非常的方便地铁就在小区门口不远处 淮海中路去哪都非常方便 ,最开心的吃到了很多小食 还有就在附近的三文鱼波奇 看了主要目的两馆的展览 真的很开心啊啊啊> <.还有miumiu很细心友好的 下次还会去哒 (o^^o)"
8910216,113380351,2017-02-28T03:55:51Z,"Beautiful place.

I loved the central heating!just kept the building nice and warm. Do play around a bit with radio/record player. Good way to start your day.

I had no problem with the whole stay. Since Miu was there in (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). She told me detailed infos about local restaurants. I don't really have any downsides to mention. 

Good public transport and location especially if you expect to visit legit underground nights in shanghai because those clubs are around the area. Big up Say Yes crew. Elevator was a nice venue.

All in all, I really liked the chilled vibe from the Henshang lu area. 
The house is nice. Go for it."
8910216,34632988,2017-02-22T03:36:06Z,地理位置太棒 在小森林住很有家的感觉 散步去武康路太幸福了 可以感受到上海的文艺气息 有机会一定等到春暖花开再来~
8910216,46429782,2017-02-19T02:41:56Z,"房子不大,但是非常令人惊喜!
本来带爸妈入住还有些担心他们不习惯,没想到两位很快就融入了,还借此体验到小空间高利用的生活。
家庭影院非常棒,晚上不用捧着手机了一起看场电影吧!新片很多,(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)扫码付款5元很方便!
最后是周边环境,很适合来上海玩的朋友,老租界feel很棒的~
推荐!"

在Airbnb上预定的小洋房价格与体验成正比,各种设备齐全,完全是我想要的未来的家,马桶也是加热各种功能都有的那种,洗漱用品都是精心准备的堪比五星级酒店的标准!傍晚和亲爱的一起骑车去买菜,自己做了一顿小小丰盛的晚餐。下次要来上海依旧选择miumiu设计的房子。感谢她给了我这次完美的体验。"

1020858,23938681,2016-09-23T01:05:43Z,"Our stay at Anna's place exceeded our expectations - we are hoping to come back next year. The island is private, beautiful, serene and 15 mins by boat from the mainland. The space is cosy and the views are stunning. There is even a wood fired sauna to warm up in after a dip in the sea. The surrounding woodland is magical and Monne who runs the taxi boat service was very friendly and amenable after our first meeting. Also reasonably easy (50mins drive) to Stockholm city. Would highly recommend this place !!! "
1020858,83056227,2016-09-06T01:10:31Z,"This is a lovely cottage to stay in, very peaceful and quiet. However it is much more complicated to get to than anticipated. "
1020858,66560436,2016-08-27T09:18:16Z,"Chouette endroit, pour décompresser, calme, beau, parfait pour un break de la ville.  "
1020858,46793289,2016-08-21T01:03:35Z,"This is an absolutely idyllic spot, with a cleverly designed compact cabin with spectacular views across the archipelago. The host was really friendly and helpful. Our teenagers enjoyed messing about in the boats and walking over the rocks, but found the water a bit cold for any extended swimming. The sauna was a treat too. We tended to light the fire in the early evening and then sit in the sauna after supper. By the time we were ready for a shower it was dusk and the shower felt quite private. Now that a professional cleaner is used between guests the cabin was really clean for our arrival. We had exceptionally bad weather and so ended up spending two days in Stockholm itself, which is linked by a convenient bus service. Our chats with the boat taxi driver who took us to the bus stop were a highlight of our visit! On the last day the sun finally came out and we visited a neighbouring uninhabited island. Earlier we had visited Linanas using the little motor boat and found a delightful cafe for lunch before taking a walk to an inland lake.
Catering was a bit of a challenge as we needed to stock up with food on the way and carry it to the boat taxi. Normally it would have been easy to buy more at the Linanas shop, but bad weather prevented us reaching there on the day our milk ran out. It was all sorted as the neighbours kindly shared their provisions with us until we could buy more. Overall I think I would recommend taking the larger house if you have teenagers, as they prefer having a bit of their own space, especially when the weather is bad. By the third week August the summer season was nearly over and some of the amenities on nearby islands were only open at weekends. I would love to visit again, perhaps earlier in the summer, and explore more of the neighbouring islands. "
1020858,6598169,2016-07-25T01:47:03Z,"We had an amazing time on the island, beautiful weather and an exceptionally nice location. The house has everything you need and Pernilla and her daughter took good care of us. 
We did not miss a proper shower as we enjoyed so much jumping into the water every morning to wash and wake up.
The island is small and we had a dog with us, so we had rented a larger boat to be able to move around in the archipelago and go for longer walks. 
Being an expat Swede, I am always amazed of how beautiful this area of Sweden is and being able to stay in such a nice house made it even better. "
1020858,29927345,2015-08-21T11:34:16Z,"Cet endroit est tout simplement splendide, le paradis ! Nous sommes une famille de 4 avec 2 enfants de 8 et 11 ans qui ont adoré l'île. La vue est magnifique, tout est très sauvage et calme. Aller faire les courses avec notre petit bateau, quel dépaysement ! La maison est petite mais très bien agencée, tout est fait que l'on se sente bien. Il y a un sauna, cannes à pêche, kayak, bateau, bref plein d'activités. La douche en plein air a bien fait rigoler les enfants, c'était très agréable.
Anna a toujours été très réactive pour répondre à nos questions, nous n'avons malheureusement pas passé beaucoup de temps avec elle sur l'île mais elle est venue à Stockholm pour tout nous expliquer avant notre arrivée : Parfait ! Le trajet en bateau taxi prend 10 minutes avec une personne très sympa, qui est très à l'heure."
1020858,32312894,2015-08-13T11:54:59Z,"Location of the House was fabulos.overall we would not Book again! 
Reasons: the house has an outside (URL HIDDEN) is not nice to be in the neighbors view at taking a shower.
the House was not cleaned properly at our Arrival,the host knew that from 2 guests in Row before us but did not fix this Defezit!we think that this is not acceptable!
The price,especially extra Charge for transfer and the high Costs for sheets/ towels (25€/person!)are not reasonable. We did not feel warmly welcome at arrival and we felt treated snobbish in general."
1020858,25730765,2015-08-09T11:06:30Z,"This is a beautiful place to stay with sea views from every window. Our host Anna was very welcoming and helped us get from Stockholm to the cottage with very little stress. She was prompt at answering our queries and helpful in supplying information about the area. The boat was very useful in traveling around the various little islands and was fairly easy to use.
"
1020858,23924820,2015-07-29T11:02:50Z,"Die Insel ist ein wahres Paradies, die Lage des Hauses einfach traumhaft. Schweden, so wie ich es in Erinnerung hatte, Steine, Felsen, Moos, Wald wie im Märchen, Stille, traumhafte Ausblicke in die Natur und das Meer! 
Pernilla stand uns mit Rat und Tat zur Seite, sämtliche weitere Bewohner der Insel könnten nicht freundlicher und liebenswerter sein!
Alles in Allem - ein wunderschöner Urlaub!"
1020858,28848152,2015-07-22T11:27:35Z,"We had a wonderful stay at the sea cottage. The views, the sauna, the boat to go shopping and explore the islands, the private jetty, the tranquillity, the jumps into the cold sea (...). Anna made sure that everything was perfectly organised and provided for, while managing to keep the perfect balance between welcoming friendliness and respecting our privacy. At first, we were a bit anxious how to get there, but the pre-organised pick-up from the Waxholmsbolaget jetty was smooth, on-time and very friendly.

As one would expect in Scandinavia, everything is expensive, but for the beautifully designed cabin, it was worth every crown. This place is one of these things that can safely be called ""priceless""

Now, if there was anything to improve, it's the overall cleanliness. I think it largely depends on who was there before you, because the final cleaning is to be done by the guests. I would suggest charging for cleaning and ""outsourcing"" it to a professional. We had to wash all our dishes, pots and pans BEFORE we used them, because the guests before us seemed to have had different idea of ""clean"". And with clean windows, we would have enjoyed the spectacular views even more :)

But this was just a tiny hitch, which did not really impair the overall grand experience and would definitely not keep us from coming back."
1020858,35184875,2015-07-18T14:20:32Z,We are four people and we enjoyed our stay here. Jumping into the water after sauna was an amazing experience. It is worthy to have a two-day holiday here. 
1020858,26401813,2015-07-16T11:05:33Z,"Das Haus befindet sich auf einer schönen kleinen Insel. Die Lage auf der Insel ist genial,  wenn das Wetter gut ist hast du den ganzen tag Sonne, weil du die Möglichkeit hast dich auf allen Seiten rund ums Haus auf zuhalten. Der große Steg ist zwar ein Gemeinschafts Bereich aber wir konnten ihn die meiste zeit für uns alleine nutzen. Die Sauna und das eintauchen ins Meer danach sind ein Traum.  Die außen dusche mit warm Wasser ist auch super. Anna ist sehr gastfreundlich und kümmert sich sehr um ihre Gäste."
1020858,1940653,2015-07-04T11:25:16Z,"Annas Haus ist perfekt für 2 bis max. 4 Personen. Wir waren mit unseren Kindern (13 und 16) dort und haben eine herrliche Woche verbracht. Das Haus hat alles was man braucht, ist sehr funktional und mit Geschmack eingerichtet und die direkte Lage am Wasser läßt die Herzen von Seglern und anderen Wassermänner und Meerjungfrauen höher schlagen. Abends Sauna und Sundowner bei unvergesslichen Sinnenuntergängen. Anna ist eine perfekte Gastgeberin und wir mussten schweren Herzens schon nach einer Woche weiterreisen. Wir freuen uns auf das nächste Mal!"
1020858,25596622,2015-06-05T11:58:29Z,"Wir waren für 10 Tage ""On the Rock"" in Stora Strängen. Alle notwendigen Informationen zu unserer An - und Abreise waren perfekt und zutreffend. Anna hat sich alle Mühe gegeben, uns über die  örtlichen Gegebenheiten zu informieren. Das Haus ist für Wasserfreunde ein wahres Paradies, das kleine Aluminiumboot eine echte Bereicherung für die Erkundung der schönen Umgebung. Ein besonderer Hit ist die Sauna. Alles in Allem eine perfekte Location und eine perfekte Gastgeberin. Wir werden wiederkommen!"
1020858,6886207,2015-05-08T14:28:48Z,"We came to Stockholm from Los Angeles looking to live like a local. So we sought out a stay in the archipelago. My wife and i are architects and were immediately drawn to this cabin. And it was beyond perfect. It was sited perfectly among the boulders. There were just so many nicely design spaces both inside and out of the cabin. Highlights included the sauna and a jump into the sea (something that should never be attempted without a sauna) We rented the boat and got snacks across the straight. The interior of the island is mossy enchantment. The main house behind the cabin is great for larger groups. We were 3 adults with 2 small kids and it was a bit tight, but half of us were Japanese and used to it!

Stove, oven, microwave, freezer, and frig. All very well appointed. Hot/cold salt water in the sink. Cold salt water outdoor shower. We brought fresh water although there is some in the main house. Bring all grocery needs. 

i think its second nature for Swedes on how to get out there, but for foreigners i can explain a bit better. We took a boat (Waxholmsboat) from near the Grand hotel. 2 Hours to Halleberg which is passed Vaxholm where the host had arranged a private boat taxi to pick us up. He was on time. 5-10 minutes later you are at her place. Phones work. Cellular data works. On the way back the same taxi boat took us to Lillesved, where we took a bus back to Stockholm (Slussen to be exact just south of Gamla Stan) That took 1.5 hours and was really convenient. BUT if you take a bus make sure you load up your bus card before you go, as you cannot load in Lillesved. 1 credit per adult per trip. We nearly got stranded out there. If we didn't have children the bus driver would have left us high and dry in the middle of nowhere in Lillesved. I do not get a sense that Swedes bend rules very often. 

It was a great adventure, something that my family will cherish forever. Thank you for sharing. You have found a truly wonderful landscape and gently crafted an architecture to make an absolutely  magical place. I am so happy for you, your family, and friends who get to stay here regularly. We will be back!
"
1020858,19797109,2014-10-02T11:34:16Z,"Anna Pernilla was a great host, she gave us all the information we needed and everything was very well organized and prepared for our arrival. We had a great, unforgettable stay on the island, especially in this lovely sea cottage with its great architecture and surrounding!  The landscape is beautiful, and we enjoyed it a lot to discover the islands with the aluminum boat. This is paradise! Thanks a lot - and we will definitely come back!"
1020858,10386359,2014-08-29T10:38:27Z,Amazing. Thank you!! The ultimate Stockholm Archipelago experience.
1020858,14063007,2014-08-10T11:17:01Z,"We've just returned from a wonderful 5 night stay... 2 adults and 2 children (ages 12 and 11) enjoying some great family time.  Diving, swimming, snorkelling and fishing were top favourites.  The small aluminium boat was brilliant and allowed us to visit some other islands.

The cottage is quite small but well designed and equipped.  It was just enough for the 4 of us but we had a lot of luggage so we left the bags outside during the day.

Amazing getaway experience...just remote enough to unwind totally, yet not too inconvenient to reach"
1020858,5793134,2014-08-04T10:37:24Z,"Ya antes de llegar la communication con  Anna Pernilla fué siempre muy agradable. Nos ayudo mucho en la organizacion del viaje. 
Por sorpresa nos invito a todos juntos con los vecinos a un ""wellcome drink"". Muchissimas gracias! Fué muy, muy sympatico!
Nos sentiamos un poco como en un pequeno paraiso! La casa y la vista panoramica es maravillosa. Passabamos todos los dias a fuera: pescando, leyendo, nadando, haciendo vueltas en canoa. Con la barca hizimos pequenos viajes para conocer las islas de la vecindad. 
Podemos recommander este sitio fantastico y Anna Pernilla "" as a perfect host"" de todo nuestro corazon!

 "
1020858,16010390,2014-07-20T11:49:12Z,"Fabolous cottage!
Du bliver sat af en sø-taxa ved en perle på en ""øde ø"". Uanset om Pernilla er der eller ej, føler du dig taget godt imod. Landet på det helt rigtige sted, på det helt rigtige tidspunkt. Alt signalerer ro, nydelse, nærvær, luksus og rå idyl. Værtsparret er perfekt, modtager dig som deres venner, med respekt for dine egne præferencer og interesse for, hvem du er. Stedet er som et perfekt postkort, der ændrer sig med solens gang over himlen, vindens susen i trætoppene og bølgernes slag mod klipperne. Du kan gå tre hundrede meter til den anden side af øen, og det er alt nok. Hytte, trapper, terasser, landgangsbro og sauna er et mikrolandskab, du aldrig får nok af. Skulle du ønske ""luft under vingerne"", kan du tage en tur i kajakken. 
Fabelagtigt sted og fabelagtig hytte til fabelagtige dage - prøv selv!"
11413628,35241258,2017-04-14T18:12:01Z,Great stay in a cool city! 
11413628,3174647,2017-04-03T15:49:12Z,"Highly recommended! This loft is spacious, clean, wide-open, & beautifully minimalist. Kyle was a gracious, helpful host who made an all-around excellent experience!"
11413628,79709490,2017-04-02T13:29:10Z,The room was amazing and the host was great throughout our stay there. We can't wait to stay there again! 
11413628,110287699,2017-03-29T14:07:57Z,Beautiful loft in a great location with plenty of room for guests to sleep! Would definitely stay here again. 
11413628,30597214,2017-03-26T15:46:04Z,"We had a pretty disappointing stay here, especially considering previous positive reviews. As other reviews mention, you do need a car for this location but downtown was only about 7-8min drive away. Check-in was very easy. While are apartment was as seen in the pictures, when we arrived in the evening we noticed that everything wasn't properly cleaned - there were dirty towels on the bathroom floor and dirty wine glasses on the counter. Aside from this sound carried a lot from other apartments including dogs barking and loud music.  Additionally, there were parties in the surrounding warehouses till the early morning. As young people, my fiancé and I obviously didn't mind, but the older people in our group did so I would definitely mostly recommend this place for a younger crowd. Communication with Kyle was great until I messaged about the dirty apartment to which I never got a response."
11413628,28225195,2017-03-20T12:14:12Z,Great huge space. I didn't encounter any problems and Kyle was a great host. 
11413628,84976,2017-03-19T14:59:50Z,Really straightforward and easy communication and check in/out process. Gorgeous loft with plenty of space and light. Would rent it again next time we're in Detroit.
11413628,69979345,2017-03-12T13:59:23Z,"Kyle's loft was amazing!! Gorgeous views, very comfortable beds, and lots and lots of sunlight. We had a fabulous time! Getting in and out with the door codes and lock boxes was very convenient. I also appreciated the parking! We made use of the games he provided and had a lot of fun. Will definitely stay in one of his properties again if I'm in Detroit! Highly recommend. "
11413628,10952626,2017-03-11T13:43:25Z,"The place is in a good location, safe. LOT'S of light. I would recommend a sleeping/eye mask if you'd like to sleep in or are sensitive to light pollution. Also maybe some earplugs. There was some rail traffic, neighbors and a dog that kept me up the first night. We moved to the smaller room the next night and I slept much better! It's clean, kinda feels like a movie set. "
11413628,32867191,2017-03-08T14:10:41Z,"In our recent trip in Detroit, we stayed at Kyle’s location for 3 days and I should say that everything came out perfect for us and our needs. 

The place is huge! Two large bedrooms (one being VERY large, with its own full bathroom) plus one another bed strategically placed, made it perfect for our 3 person trip. 

The common area is convenient and comfortable. Everything needed was available in the kitchen, but we didn’t used much of it (as we got diner outside every evening).

Location is quiet and close to the highway 94, allowing us to get to the loft from the airport in little more than 20 minutes. Instructions where VERY clear, and we experienced no problems at all to get the keys and access the building. 

Lot of excellent recommendation for restaurants and breakfast places (we did go to New Center Eatery on Grand Blvd and Rose’s Fine Food on Jefferson east - both excellent choice!).  

Gated car parking is available in the back and is very secure.  The place is clean, as is the whole building. Each of us had bath towels prepared for us and we didn’t missed anything.
 
In short. GREAT place. STRONGLY recommended. 

Perfect as a central pad to explore this beautiful city and it’s wonderful people!"
11413628,17139914,2017-02-26T15:47:20Z,Great apartment and perfect location for exploring the city.
11413628,19951292,2017-02-06T14:35:26Z,Kyle's spot was great; very clean with plenty of space. Kyle made checking in and checking out very easy and was easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend this spot for anyone and would love to stay again.
11413628,111427730,2017-02-05T13:52:43Z,Absolutely beautiful loft with an amazing view! 
11413628,22196527,2017-02-03T15:44:37Z,"Great place, great location, great value"
11413628,52037057,2017-01-14T14:31:53Z,"Interior as pictured, large space, well maintained."
11413628,17541201,2017-01-06T13:43:34Z,This was our second time staying at this location.  Kyle is always a great host and the space is excellent for corporate events/stays.
11413628,37290483,2017-01-03T16:46:51Z,"What a fun experience at Kyle's place! We absolutely love this loft! Very spacious and clean, and the layout was just fun for our kids. Checking in and out was also very easy. I definitely will recommend it to my friends. "
11413628,1583338,2016-12-29T15:14:18Z,"A great, spacious, light filled apartment in a cool, former industrial part of detroit that feels safe and centrally located."
11413628,40623290,2016-12-27T14:16:54Z,"Kyle was great with communication, the Airbnb was in a location close to a lot of attractions downtown, and the unit itself was cool. Would definitely recommend."
11413628,104568073,2016-12-14T16:02:49Z,Kyle was on point. Place was on point. Accommodating for sure. 
803710,36397752,2017-04-27T13:31:01Z,"Very nice, cute loft space! Clean and well taken care of. "
803710,95346727,2017-04-25T09:50:25Z,Great place for a good price! Close to public transportation.
803710,100793822,2017-04-21T09:21:08Z,"We stayed in the apartment for 5 days, and we wish we could have stayed longer. The place is beautiful, clean and in the perfect neighborhood. There's cafés, restaurants and supermarkets close by and the Metro will take you into the city in 15 minutes.
Claudio was a great host, on time for the check in (even though we arrived a bit earlier than expected) and answered all messages and his phone immediately.
We would love to come back!"
803710,31539859,2017-04-16T06:41:01Z,"Appartement super pour y loger un weekend, il est propre et très bien entretenu. Un accueil très chaleureux de Claudio. Le métro est à 2 min de la station RE DI ROMA, très pratique pour se diriger vers les lieux incontournables de Rome.

Thanks"
803710,81307616,2017-04-12T07:29:18Z,"Great location, ideal for 2 adults and 2 kids.  "
803710,71719382,2017-04-09T07:05:24Z,This was a great little place with some of the best gelato right down stairs. Claudio was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. 
803710,88194765,2017-04-08T06:43:57Z,"Claudio's place was great.  A short walk to the metro, and not too far from Tuscolana station if you're getting the train from Fiumicino Airport.  The apartment is clean with a very comfortable bed.  All you could need to cook for yourself, but there are some great little restaurants in the area.  Claudio was very responsive to our needs via text or email - although we never actually met him, his mother Anna met us at the door and showed us the facilities.  Great stay!"
803710,66729303,2017-04-05T07:46:05Z,"Lovely neat and clean apartment with all the essentials in a nice area with good cafes and eateries!
Claudio was helpful and friendly
I would stay there again and recommend it!"
803710,13282889,2017-04-03T04:07:06Z,"Wow this is a great place to stay in Rome. The apartment is quite spacious, clean, really well set up and in a lovely area with great food options. Best of all it a short 5 minute stroll to the subway. We were met on arrival by Claudio's mum who gave us a great orientation. Thanks Claudio, we would definitely be heading for your place if we come to Rome again!"
803710,111942477,2017-03-28T06:26:38Z,"Had a great stay in this little apartment.
In such a great area, away from all the busy crowds but close enough to all the attractions by metro.
Will Definitely recommend to friends & family who are planning on visiting.
Great little cafe for breakfast nextdoor to apartment, and fairly cheap. Metro a couple minute walk away & only 8 stops to the main city. Super quick & easy. 
Only little niggle was the bathroom wasn't very clean. Thick layers of dust around the skirting boards & top of tiles, starting to get brown stain on bottom of toilet, just needs some bleach & good scrub.
Towels were fresh & clean tho.
Thanks again for a great stay "
803710,85428205,2017-03-25T09:22:27Z,"The flat:
A great place to stay. The flat is in a complex which is lovely. Bit noisy as you can hear the neighbours. Fold out sofa which was comfy, as was the bed. We were given linens and towels, which was a nice touch. Cleaning products also left to use. No TV in the main area, which would be nice.
The location:
The cafe next door is amazing and a good price. The metro is a few minutes walk (2 mins), you can even walk to the colloseum which is a nice scenic route. There's a local supermarket across the road for general amenities (water, tea bags etc). Lots of cheap pizza places and gelaterias. 
All in all, great place."
803710,10246229,2017-03-17T11:12:39Z,"This apartment was very close to the metro line A, which has all the main sights, great little apartment with everything you need. Go to the restaurant Trattoria Etruria around the corner, best meal we had in Rome. Thanks Claudio"
803710,99085300,2017-03-13T08:35:24Z,"Lovely little place, perfect for a short stay in Rome. Very close to public transport! Clean apartment and very friendly host! thanks!"
803710,85383888,2017-03-11T10:36:30Z,"Recomendado, muy buen lugar! "
803710,31354373,2017-03-08T08:05:12Z,"A very cosy apartment in a great location, close to city centre and metro station, walking distance from Collosseum. The apartment was clean and exactly as described, everything was in place. We had a really great time and enjoyed our stay in Rome. Claudio was a great host, the communciation was good, we did not have any problems. Looking forward to visiting Rome once again!"
803710,77849348,2017-03-01T04:53:51Z,"We loved Claudio's apartment. Just a minute's walk from Re Di Roma metro stop, you can pretty much get to anywhere you want around Rome in less than 20mins. His home was neat and clean but we would have only loved for the kitchen to be a little more equipped (and we say this because we had a baby traveling with us and are comparing this to other airbnb stays we've had) But overall we do not have any complaints as he was a good host and explained well details about how to enter and use the facilities in his home. He came well on time for the check out as well and was good to talk to. His home is in a very convenient location and has a lot of eateries and a supermarket just a stone throw's away. Nearby was a public park/garden too where we took our baby to play in the evenings. I loved the neighbourhood. Was busy and peaceful at the same time."
803710,110000311,2017-02-12T08:35:44Z,"Had a lovely stay at Claudios place, nice, clean and tidy. Next door to a lovely restaurant - perfect for breakfast!
Bring ear plugs because the overall building can be quite noisy at times! Slightly further out of the centre of Rome than initially thought, 20-30minute walk, but a metro is 2 minutes from the apartment and easy to get around.  "
803710,65632268,2017-02-08T09:06:08Z,"Claudio's house is located in a pretty central neighborhood in Rome. The apartment is really nice, but small, so I sincerely suggest it to all the couple which are planning a trip in Rome. If you're more than 2  but you're enough flexible, you may try to arrange it anyway. "
803710,87914028,2017-02-07T08:51:23Z,Comfortable place with required facilities nearby. 
803710,11805881,2017-02-05T08:44:46Z,"Een prima appartement op goed te bereiken lokatie! Zag er netjes uit, meest basale keukenbenodigdheden waren aanwezig. Claudio kan goede tips voor restaurantjes in de buurt en bezienswaardigheden geven. Rustige lokatie. 
Prima verblijf voor een stedentrip in Rome! "
4905030,18359559,2017-04-25T05:26:35Z,"Great place to stay in Tokyo. Good location for eating and shopping around. The caravan is so cool! Nice bed and shower.

4905030,35832205,2017-04-06T23:54:14Z,Nice one ! Every traveller need to try 
4905030,15871383,2017-04-03T00:37:34Z,"My favorite place to stay in Tokyo. This was my second time staying at caravan Tokyo. The location is absolutely fantastic. Nestled in a hip co-op with great food and beers to keep you going between explorations of the city. It's only a 2 minute walk to the nearest subway, and 10 minute walk to neighborhoods like Harajuku and shibuya. It's a lively space, but at 10pm it shuts down and it's dead quiet for a relaxing sleep in a perfectly equipped caravan. "
4905030,34012237,2017-03-29T01:09:39Z,房子很独特   但是个人觉得价格有点高   后面就是酒吧街  环境是很方便的   身高高的人慎住  因为本人一米七  已经撞了好多次门了   哈哈哈
4905030,60495824,2017-03-26T23:14:07Z,"Fun area to walk around, the room is on the small end if you have large suitcases."
4905030,17921294,2017-03-24T00:54:38Z,"非常棒的旅行体验。很酷的氛围。地段很好,出门2分钟就是表参道地铁站。不过性价比稍低,而且房东回复信息不够及时。"
4905030,35312726,2017-03-22T00:49:27Z,"The place to stay in Tokyo, no doubt about it."
4905030,49143635,2017-03-19T23:40:39Z,Very special experience!
4905030,22429485,2017-03-15T01:40:55Z,Perfect Location!
4905030,6955042,2017-03-10T23:51:23Z,Great place! Close to Shibuya and excellent location. 
4905030,50623395,2017-03-08T23:49:08Z,"The coolest place in town! Blue bottle cafe is next door! I will come just for relax. 

PS: read the details for how to get in after 10PM, it will take you some time if you do not know how to get back from other entrance."
4905030,7042600,2017-02-15T01:51:54Z,"Awesome location right in the heart of Roppongi. This caravan is great for a couples trip.
The trick to staying in tight quarters is organization. This caravan is surprisingly comfortable and the check on process couldn't have been easier."
4905030,110909467,2017-02-07T23:14:44Z,"This is a lovely place, very personal, gave us a lot of surprises. Next to the commercial street, there are many delicious, traffic is also very convenient, subway in the vicinity. This is a pleasant trip, thanks to the landlord :)"
4905030,102307631,2016-12-25T01:20:52Z,キレイでした!

Great atmosphere!!
Great experience!!!

After 10PM, you got the whole Commune 246 by yourself.
The Caravan is there just for the guest.  Please make sure do not bring any luggage or kids to the Caravan."
4905030,8777893,2016-11-25T03:46:48Z,"The place is just like in the photos. Very easily accessible by metro. And there's tons of things to do nearby. It's more of a modern/different place to stay, rather than a fancy place. It's definitely a fun place to stay. "
4905030,57734214,2016-11-23T04:47:14Z,"Great location, atmosphere and experience! If you are a single or couple looking to explore the city and do so in a unique way..this is a perfect option! Spent 9 days at the caravan on my honeymoon and loved every moment! "

2952215,120448506,2017-05-08T01:10:24Z,사진에서 보이는 그대로 아늑하고 깨끗한 숙소였습니다. 저희는 친구 3명이 묵었지만 4~5명까지도 가능할 것 같아요. 밤에 2층 테라스에서 별도 많이 보여서 넘 좋았네요 ㅎㅎ 쾌적하고 한가로워서 편히 쉴 수 있는 공간이었습니다.
2952215,38603251,2017-04-21T01:40:18Z,Lisa's place is nice and cosy. It's a bit secluded from town area but if we had a car so that was no problem. Nice to live in the countryside for a change and enjoy the peace. Will recommend to anyone looking for a cosy place to stay in Jeju! 
2952215,41864259,2017-04-16T04:25:15Z,"A cosy, little guesthouse on the outskirts os Seguipo. The area is peaceful, quiet and stunning to look at with the ocean and orange trees everywhere in sight. All of Jeju's main attractions are accessible by bus from right near the house and the Olle trail is only seconds away. Lisa was a charming host, ensuring that I had everything I need and knew where to go. I would happily have stayed longer and hope to come back again."
2952215,62215190,2017-04-09T02:25:24Z,"Highly recommend. A beautiful, private place, perfect as a base for exploring Jeju island. Lisa was fantastic and a great host"
2952215,22484809,2017-04-04T01:00:07Z,"Lisa is a very friendly and lovely person. Lisa's place is exactly the same as the pictures. Very warm and cozy. Lisa prepared all the warmers and electric blankets for us. She even prepared coffee for us in the morning. We rented the private tour, Lisa personally drove us around. She recommended some very local very delicious food, and also to many attractions in Jeju. Lisa is very detailed and sweet too. She remembered that we had difficulty sitting on the floor during the first meal, the next two days she requested for seats with chairs at the restaurants. Lisa speaks very well English, I was able to communicate with her throughout the entire trip. Will definitely come and stay at Lisa's place again during my next trip. Highly recommend this place for small family or even small group of friends. "
2952215,18161001,2017-03-14T01:38:13Z,Dear Lisa thank you again for hosting us and helping us to book a taxi when we are in need of help. We are very grateful and happy to stay in your apartment for 2 nights! Lisa is friendly and good in English communication. We will definitely book your apartment again when I come back to Jeju again! Bed were comfortable and my Husband and I had very good sleep. The view were beautiful and we had a kitchen to cook our food!!! :) thank you Lisa and take care! God bless you 
2952215,92777436,2017-02-22T02:26:28Z,"Cosy home and well equipped with necessities. Very nice host (Lisa) who also runs the cafe next door, their signature spicy chicken and also the beef dish are very tasty! If you are indecisive of what to eat, you can just walk next door. Their cooking made me feel at home (literally) and is such a great addition to my holiday. 

Location is secluded from the city and stores but travelling the island with a rental car easily resolves that. There are local restaurants and convenience stores to easily drive to, including a bbq restaurant to try Jeju Black Pork (called Hayoung Hayoung, Lisa has more info)! 

Lisa is absolutely willing to go out of her way to help during our stay, even with renting hiking equipment (store's website was in korean) to be delivered to the home before the day of hike! So nice! 

The outside rooftop view glances around the neighbourhood and also allows visibility of the island's Hallasan mountain, which I loved seeing every morning when I woke up.  

Would definitely stay at Lisa's place again. "
2952215,106013192,2017-01-24T02:57:16Z,조용한 숙소입니다. 
2952215,47439719,2017-01-02T01:38:23Z,"Lisa's place is quiet, clean and warm. 
She turned on the heating before we got back each evening. She left us a packet of dried citrus peel from her orchard the night before we left. Thanks Lisa.
Though our we didn't have much time with her, she was warm and helpful and responded to our queries almost immediately. We had a pleasant stay. "
2952215,18621125,2016-12-26T00:23:42Z,"정말로 감사드립니다. 늦게 체크인 했음에도, 친절하게 잘 안내해 주신 점, 진심으로 깔끔하고 편안한 숙소를 제공해 주신 점 진심으로 감사드립니다 ^^"
2952215,32955195,2016-12-11T00:15:44Z,"Lisa was a wonderfully hospitable. We arrived pretty late in the evening but she had no problems with that.  After checking in, we were pretty hungry and she recommended a nice cozy Black pork BBQ restaurant nearby.  Her place was rather secluded and quite challenging to reverse our car out each morning.  At the same time, we loved that it was secluded and surrounded by orange trees. Lisa was very thoughtful, turning on the heat for us in the evening so we would return to a warm place.  She also had a washing machine so we could get our laundry done.  And she provided the necessary toiletries so we won't need to bring any ourselves.  Thanks, Lisa for being a great host!"
2952215,66568171,2016-11-07T23:59:21Z,"Lisa warmly welcomed us when we arrive and she show us around her listing and briefly let us know the do's and dont's. Lisa place located slightly far from city but it is very relaxing! 
The room is very clean and fully equipped with all sort of utilities, Lisa even gave us some fresh jeju orange. Highly recommended to stay in. Will definitely visit again someday"
2952215,69109084,2016-11-06T02:55:45Z,"Stayed here for 2 nights with 3 others; wished I had stayed longer in Jeju! The hospitality we received from Lisa and her brother Mr Kim completed our very memorable Jeju experience :) From start to end, they were there to receive us and send us off. They are also able to communicate freely in English. The place is away from the city area but we drove so it's easy to locate by simply inputting the address provided by Lisa into the GPS. On one night, we even had dinner at their cafe - the food is highly recommended! Will definitely be back here again :)

아주 아주 좋아ㅏㅏㅏ! 호스트 Lisa씨 너무 친절해서 고마워요 ^^* 곧 다시 와요~"
2952215,66976680,2016-11-03T11:52:58Z,"Is a very warm house provided by Lisa. It was quite near to the sea therefore, she provided with warm floor, warm air, warm bed & even warm bathroom. Although it was 15minutes away from seongwipo city but it was nice and cheap place to stay over. "
2952215,24211819,2016-10-28T23:25:37Z,2nd time... and always be the best staying place... love love love
2952215,23136042,2016-10-23T00:10:25Z,"Lisa's place is nice and cozy, exactly as the pictures shown. 
Her warm hospitality made us feel welcome and we enjoyed the stay much. "
2952215,22179809,2016-10-21T03:02:10Z,good! 
2952215,59299681,2016-10-17T01:34:25Z,"We had a very nice stay at Lisa's lovely place. 
She has such a welcoming personality and a great family. 
If you have a car or don't mind spending some time on transport to other tourist attractions up in the north, then definitely give this place a try!!"
2952215,16592011,2016-10-16T06:42:07Z,"Many thanks for Lisa, we reach late night at 12/10 by taxi, and she brought us to convenient store to get some noodle and food. She recommend us the places and food which are taste nice ( ginseng chicken) , her bro Mr.Kim is our private driver on the next day, it is good for one day tour we mainly focus on east side sightseeing place. The location is not very convenient if you don't have car but we manage to travel by public bus which is ok for us, but pity that we didn't manage see any stars due to cloudy weather. Many thanks for Lisa and her Brother Mr Kim. "
2952215,63174016,2016-10-10T02:05:07Z,"저녁 9시에 체크인을 하는데도 따뜻하고 반갑게 맞아주셨습니다. 비가 오고 바람이 많은 날이었는데 방은 환하고 따뜻하게 준비가 되어 있었고요.. 꼭 필요한것들만 아기자기하고 깨끗하게 준비가 되어 있었습니다. 집앞 귤밭도 멋지고 멀리 보이는 바다와 밤하늘이 별까지... 아쉬울 것이 하나도 없는 숙소였습니다~ 아이 둘과 같이 갔는데, 아이가 어려서 화장실이 추울까 걱정했는데, 온열기라고 하나요? 그런것까지 세심하게 준비되어 있고 따뜻한 물도 아주 잘 나와서 편하게 있었습니다. 다시 가고싶네요~~ "
36347,30459796,2017-05-07T11:45:18Z,"good, if lively location. very well apportioned apartment with practically everything you may need and more.
Accurate description.
Recommended!"
36347,2735633,2017-04-20T09:47:46Z,"This is a beautiful space with great light and because we were traveling for a couple of weeks, having access to the laundry facilities was helpful.  Alan left local coffee, fresh flowers and snacks which was much appreciated.  Uber works in this area like a charm.  We barely had time to get downstairs if we contacted Uber from the apartment.  The location is within walking distance to many cafes and restaurants. Alan left a great reference book of ideas for guests that we found incredibly useful.  The ladder to the loft is a bit steep and may not be for every age and/or disposition."
36347,23465799,2017-03-29T09:48:14Z,"Alan's place is a beautiful and well-appointed oasis in the city.  Wonderful and thoughtful touches, such as local coffee, fruit, and a bottle of wine made us immediately feel at home. Alan and his partners gave spot-on local advice and put together a terrific city guide. A small patio with amazing views and nearby pool access completed the feeling of having a vacation within a vacation. Hope to stay with Alan again! "
36347,41010561,2017-03-24T09:14:50Z,Great location. Stunning and quirky interior with all the necessary amenities. Definitely recommend 
36347,94073959,2017-03-19T07:44:48Z,Great place and very central! The loft and the lights are beautifully designed and from the balcony you have an awesome view in the direction of table mountain! Will definitely stay there again!
36347,43611288,2017-03-15T06:43:17Z,"We had a fantastic stay at the loft. As a daughter and mother visiting Cape Town for 5 nights, the property had everything we could have wished for. The location is super central, and we've loved exploring the surrounding streets and restaurants (many great ones recommended in the loft guide!) We couldn't recommend Alan's place enough, fab stay! "
36347,95006944,2017-03-10T08:07:06Z,Väldigt bra boende centralt i Kapstaden! Enkelt att kommunicera med värden som mötte våra requirements vad gällde in- och utcheckning. Mycket bra tips om restauranger och annat att göra i närheten också. 
36347,6757755,2017-03-02T09:16:24Z,"We loved everything about Alan's place - it's super cool! The flat itself is really well put together and very stylish. The balcony has an amazing view, so nice to have some outside space too. The pool is super swanky and much appreciated, not to mention the car parking space. Which is so useful in that busy part of town. - Both in the building across the road. The location is bang in the centre of Cape Town. Alan and his team were very helpful and accommodating as well. Many thanks, Max and Max "
36347,78317661,2017-03-01T04:45:23Z,"Sofortige Kontaktaufnahme per Telefon, also sehr persönlich. Auch vor Ort jederzeit erreichbar. Die persönliche Einweisung in das Objekt war vorbildlich. Loft sehr gut ausgestattet. Hier fehlt es an nix, selbst ein Trockner ist vorhanden. Bäckerei, Supermarkt, Restaurants, Bars einen Steinwurf entfernt. Viele POI sind fussläufig erreichbar. Trotz zentraler Lage relativ ruhig gelegen. Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Bei Ankunft wurde uns eine kalte Flasche Wein offeriert. Abreise und Zeitvereinbarung unkompliziert. Wir können diese Unterkunft uneingeschränkt wärmstens empfehlen."
36347,4687536,2017-02-14T09:35:41Z,"schöne Wohnung, super Lage in der Innenstadt"
36347,22892632,2017-02-09T06:57:00Z,"Central location , great nearby bars and restaurants. Safe building."
36347,21678581,2017-01-21T08:58:25Z,Gorgeous design led studio in the heart of the city.  Perfect for a young couple looking to check out all of the trendy bars and hipster food scene!
36347,12432020,2017-01-16T07:25:58Z,Alan's loft if awesome! Great location to explore the city and experience life like a Capetonian.
36347,10714097,2017-01-11T03:06:18Z,"Alan's apartment is the perfect spot to get a real feel of living in Cape Town. Centrally located, perfect for any length of stay, you are walking distance from tons of fabulous restaurants and bars and only a short, inexpensive Uber ride to the beaches. Alan is super quick to communicate and was happy to help with anything we needed. The apartment itself is very clean and organized.  It's very charming with a lovely view of Table Mountain. There is lots of room to unpack if you decide to stay awhile too. We loved our stay here and would definitely choose to stay here again! Thanks Alan for everything!"
36347,7846178,2017-01-03T02:45:07Z,"I stayed my second time in Alans loft and I cannot say enough good things about Alan and his beautiful and amazing apartment. If you are a design addict like me you will love it. As always fridge is filled up when I arrived. The location is incredible, close to Long and Bree street. I will definitely come again. Thank you, Alan! "
36347,73284781,2016-12-19T01:35:37Z,We had a fantastic time at Alan's place and hope to return. Great location - we became morning regulars a five minute walk away at Truth Coffee on Buitenkant Street (great coffees and breakfasts) and for evening cocktails a five minute walk away at Tjing Tjing bar (in the roof of a 200 year old house) on Longmarket Street!
36347,6626070,2016-12-10T11:43:20Z,"My husband and I were travelling through South Africa on our honeymoon. Alan's place was great! Really clean and cosy - it has a really cool vibe to it and as soon as you are inside feels like an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's quiet and has everything you need - including wine!
The neighbourhood was a bit more hectic than I am used to and I was often approached for money as I left the building. This is no reflection on Alan or the apartment, it was still a great place to stay, but should be noted if you are travelling alone. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed.
In saying that, we would definitely stay again. Alan was always quick to respond with any queries and always helpful."
36347,7469978,2016-12-04T06:40:00Z,Alan's place was great! Awesome location in the centre of the city & fully equipped for home cooking. Will definitely stay here again next time we travel to SA. 
36347,39196769,2016-11-29T06:54:22Z,"Oh my - this is a phenomenally well designed loft apartment. I wish I could live in something this trendy every week. 
Alan is a great, responsive host, who leaves tasty treats in the fridge. If you are okay with steep stairs I highly recommend staying here. 
(Oh, and be sure to check out the pool as well - especially on hot CT days)"
36347,1358253,2016-11-13T06:10:17Z,"Had an incredible time at Alan's apartment on Longmarket Street. 

Perfect location for all the many cool bars, restaurants and coffee shops in the close area. 

Never met Alan but he andwered the many annoying questions I had very promptly. Many thanks. 

The apartment was clean and fantastic, loved it from the off and will easily book it again as want to return to Cape Town soon."
471581,114497734,2017-03-25T06:56:45Z,Excellent place! Excellent concept! Thank you Bella! 
471581,62369002,2017-03-13T05:09:26Z,"The photos were true to life. Bella was quick to respond to all contact and helpful with arrival time etc. The house is well located, the garden is super. Being in a wooded setting there were a few issues with ants, mainly due to the fruit the monkeys were dropping from the trees. Good to have WiFi. Thanks."
471581,3634000,2017-02-24T06:25:16Z,A wonderfully green and peaceful retreat from the busyness of Nairobi. Definitely worth checking out. 
471581,22770783,2017-02-06T07:25:22Z,"It's a pity that I had to leave. Bella's place works very well for people who search for a quiet, green spot in Nairobi. Will certainly return. Bella, thank you for being such an excellent host. "
471581,25582015,2017-01-11T20:58:40Z,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
471581,57087409,2017-01-05T08:09:05Z,"Great and serene place which is not far from amenities.

Greatly recommended"
471581,7475115,2016-12-17T05:33:49Z,"Very quiet and peaceful stay away from the bustle of Nairobi. Plus it's a great value! We had to use Ubers to get anywhere, but if that is okay with you, the trees and birds are so worth it. Bella is a kind and easy-going host as well. "
471581,37012682,2016-12-08T07:54:06Z,"Beautiful not so little cabin, it was more than large enough for my wife, daughter, and sister-in-law. Finding a quiet and secure place in the city can be a challenge, we feel we did well finding Bella's place.  Plenty of flowers, trees, and birds to keep a feeling of peace.  The monkeys pay a visit each morning crashing through the trees and landing on the roof, but if you like a little wildlife in your morning wake-up routine it is pretty entertaining.  This was a good location for us needing access to the US Embassy multiple times over our stay, just enough distance to be affordable and close enough to not deal with Nairobi's traffic.  We liked it enough to extend our stay.  "
471581,7439463,2016-12-02T05:08:23Z,"Great place, everything as described. Bella arranged pick up from the airport, very smooth check-in and comfortable stay. Allow a bit of time for Uber to find you there..."
471581,41289822,2016-11-02T05:31:47Z,"This place was a really welcome retreat from the noise and dust. It's in Garden Estate, so you are behind several walls, and feel like you are in a forest. Bella was really helpful, and kept in contact. Let her know what you want/need ahead of time, and she can arrange it. The WiFi was the fastest I've experienced in Nairobi, but make sure you tell her if you are a big television watcher (I think that particular signal isn't as great). I would go here again in a heartbeat."
471581,17458141,2016-10-02T07:43:18Z,"Bella's house is gorgeous, green and secluded. Had a lovely stay and would gladly stay there again!"
471581,53035100,2016-09-02T10:28:04Z,"Bella ensured you enjoyed your privacy. For things not even provided in the listing, she was ready to find a way to make the service available like laundry (fees apply)."
471581,6546378,2016-07-16T03:46:41Z,"Bella was awesome and the place was perfect for our two week stay! It is close to the Thika Road Highway and both the Garden City Mall, Thika Road Mall and the Village Market mall. Would highly recommend a stay here! "
471581,34355782,2016-06-28T01:19:20Z,Bellas place was beautiful. She was kind and very helpfull. I would Reccomend her cabin to other Airbnb Travellers.
471581,75340227,2016-06-06T08:31:36Z,"Bella's place is beautiful, scenic and peaceful. It is we'll suited to an individual looking for a home away from home"
471581,54437521,2016-05-21T02:03:46Z,"I really enjoyed my stay. The place was beautiful and surrounding grounds were gorgeous (large lawn and mature garden/trees). Bella did a great job at communicating with me and helping me get to her place from the airport.  I was there for a conference at Safari Park Lodge, which was conveniently only a few minutes away. "
471581,11782168,2016-03-15T17:23:58Z,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
471581,8446792,2016-03-02T14:14:00Z,Bella was a really great host. The house is very nice and has a lush garden. I invited some friends over on BBQ and she was very helpful. The pictures of the house gives a good description on how it looks. The surrounding area is very quite and I always felt completely safe. This is a place that I would like to return to the next time I go to Nairobi. 
471581,48605919,2016-01-27T13:10:09Z,The listing is accurate. The neighbourhood is quiet peacful and in a serene environment.
471581,1527332,2016-01-11T14:54:15Z,"Bella was an extremely gracious host and her place is lovely! We had three people stay at the villa ( Me, my girlfriend and my brother) and the space was more than adequate. Bella met us in person when we arrived and showed us around. Her caretakers were on had to help but were not intrusive. I had guests over to the house on the second day for a BBQ and everyone had a lovely time, Bella was accommodating even though we ended up with a few more people at the BBQ than I had initially anticipated and communicated. I highly recommend this stay for a quite get away from the hustle and bustle of Nairobi!"
663725,6126307,2017-05-06T06:14:27Z,"Nous avons passé un superbe séjour en famille dans la Villa de Sergio. La Villa est telle que sur les photos, magnifique ! Prendre son petit dejeuner tous les matins face à cette vue sur la mer est une expérience inoubliable. Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Sergio. Il nous a même offert un gâteau d'anniversaire. Un grand merci à lui ! A bientôt."
663725,43319278,2017-04-30T14:31:51Z,Comfortable and well-equipped villa in a beautiful garden with olive groves around. Perfect place to relax. And very caring owner.
663725,54518627,2017-04-22T06:09:34Z,This is a great place to stay-comfortable and bright. 10 mins drive to Monopoli and interesting sights within about an hours drive-although we were very happy just relaxing in the house. Very well equipped including pizza oven :-) Sergio kept in contact throughout our stay and also provided lots of useful Baby equipment which was really helpful. 
663725,13612493,2017-04-15T09:33:02Z,"Nous avons passé un séjour très agréable dans cette propriété. La villa est réellement aussi belle que sur les photographies : lumineuse, spacieuse, confortable, très propre... aucune mauvaise surprise. La vue depuis la terrasse est extraordinaire : la piscine en premier plan,le jardin d'oliviers et la mer en arrière plan....nous ne nous en sommes pas lassés !
Nous avons séjourné dans cette villa avec nos trois enfants (8, 6 et 2 ans), ravis eux aussi. Nous recommandons donc vivement cette villa, qui se situe à moins de 10 minutes de Monopoli où l'on trouve tous les commerces. Enfin est pour ne rien gâcher Sergio est très sympathique et nous avons été ravis de notre rencontre..."
663725,15929528,2017-04-08T08:57:23Z,"Sergio's house is a beautifully executed modern build with a great view. Two good-sized double rooms share a nice bathroom, while the huge master bedroom has a large shower room. The open living space is fabulous with glass front that you can open up, the kitchen is perfect (with the best knives I have ever come across in a rented property), there's a sunny raised patio outside and a few steps down to the infinity pool.

The house is designed for all-year living, so on a couple of cold April nights we resorted to the central heating which worked very well indeed. The house has everything you could want, all fixtures and fittings are modern and everything worked.

Sergio made the check-in very simple. He met us in town and led us to the house. He and his brother-in-law were on hand for our occasional questions. 

The area is fantastic, with the coastal towns of Monopoli and Polignano a short drive away. Both have historic centres which are well worth exploring and there is no shortage of good restaurants.

Our family of four loved our week at Sergio's. It is a really special house in a very relaxing part of the world."
663725,27152763,2016-10-16T03:18:09Z,"The moment you drive up the the gate and it opens you know you will enter something special. The villa is amazing and the white colour really stands out. The lay-out is perfect as the big glass sliding doors in the living and kitchen are all focused around the lovely pool area and of course the sea view. It is really relaxing, the area is quiet and together with the high standards in the villa you will experience a lovely stay. The host Sergio is really responsive and even took time to come and visit us to introduce himself and to share any tips of the area. All and all I cannot recommend this place more as our two weeks there were fantastic. "
663725,16228480,2016-09-04T03:11:42Z,"This the best house I have ever stayed through AirBnB and other websites. My husband, my 2 year old daughter and I had a fantastic time in Sergio's house. It was a work of art with many details around every room. You can see the house was built with love and care. Sergio is a great host, extremely kind and knowledgable. We arrived at the house with a warm welcome. Sergio brought us lots of toys, baby chair, pushchair etc. whatever we need. We followed his recommendation for local restaurants and places to visit. They were all great. We spent all week playing in the pool, cooking food on the BBQ and admiring the nice garden. We felt very sad the holiday was over and we had to leave. But we would definitely like to come back again! Thank you Sergio and family!"
663725,24018190,2016-08-28T00:54:50Z,"Location ottima, molto vicina a Polignano a mare e a Monopoli.
Questa villa spettacolare è una perfetta alternativa di soggiorno in una Puglia affollata di turisti.
Casa accogliente e arredata con gusto, spazio esterno ampio con bbq e forno per ottime grigliate e la piscina rende il soggiorno ancora più piacevole!
Ideale anche per bambini, Sergio è una persona molto disponibile e nel caso mette a disposizione tutte le attrezzature utili.
Molto consigliato!

663725,38962290,2016-07-24T00:18:01Z,"Nous avons passé un fantastique séjour dans la villa de Sergio et Stefania.

La terrasse en teck, la piscine et les abords sont magnifiques, nous en avons profité tout le temps.
Le site est merveilleux, sur une colline au milieu des oliviers millénaires et surplombant la région avec une vue panoramique sur la mer. Le site est paisible et serein. 
La villa est très sécurisée, avec une alarme totale simple d'utilisation et des villas autour (qui sont loin donc préservant l'intimité). Nous étions avec nos 3 enfants dont 2 jumelles de 5 ans et nous sommes sentis parfaitement bien. 
La villa est idéalement placée pour visiter tous les jolis villages alentours et la côte. D'ailleurs la région est incroyable à visiter.
Sergio est un hôte adorable qui fait tout pour qu'on se sente bien dans sa maison et sa région qu'il aime expliquer.
Nous recommandons fortement la villa de Sergio.

663725,50534724,2016-07-09T08:40:15Z,"We had a great relaxing week at Sergio's villa. It is so peaceful and not overlooked. The infinity pool is fantastic. Villa is very spacious and all ultra modern -
We ate out most of the time using the recommendations at the villa in nearby Monopoli and beyond.

Sergio was excellent in guiding us to the villa and making sure all our requests we at hand.
Would highly recommend this place to anyone. If you want quiet place tucked away in the Italian countryside but still only 10min drive from civilisation - this is it 

Thanks Sergio and we plan a return trip next year "
663725,16790539,2016-07-04T00:30:32Z,The host was very friendly and helpful. The location is no good as it is far from anything worth experiencing. Need car and gps to do anything. The area is unsafe and not recommended for families who are unfamiliar with the location. We were robbed from a break and enter and do not recommend this villa to anyone. 
663725,5190612,2016-06-27T03:49:36Z,"We could not have asked for a more comfortable and well equipped home for our week in Puglia.  Everything was beautifully organized, and we appreciated the gracious touches added to enhance our stay, including a cake for the various events we were celebrating on the trip.  The pictures perfectly depict the space.  The pool is gorgeous and pristine.  The 5-minute drive into Monopoli is straightforward, and we enjoyed the town much more than we thought we would.  We'd anticipated more day trips around the region, but the locale was great and we only ventured south a few times.   Sergio and his property management team are great.  We could not recommend them more highly."
663725,14027974,2016-06-20T03:05:30Z,"La villa e' favolosa! Immacolata ed estremamente confortevole. Sergio e' una persona squisita e di immensa gentilezza. La location perfetta a pochi minuti da Monopoli, Polignano a mare e bellissime spiagge."
663725,52424973,2016-05-29T03:37:16Z,"Eigenaar was in Rome en kon ons niet ontvangen. Dit werd gedaan door locale agent. Zij is ons, na een afgesproken punt, voorgereden naar de villa.
Alles was prima in orde! Goede bedden die al waren ophemaakt en prima airco. Het zwembad was een grote plus en heel schoon. Mooie omgeving, je hebt wel een auto nodig. Prima informatie over de omgeving ontvangen ca 10 dagen voor aankomst.
Wij waren zeer tevreden en hebben genoten."
663725,23171525,2016-05-16T00:26:04Z,"Sergio is the best host. He organized an agency to take care of our needs while he was away. At the same time he was constantly in contact to ensure our holiday was just perfect. (Even trying to change the weather :)) The place has the best view and all the amenities are there. It is just a few minutes away to drive down the slope to the nearest town Monopoli. A very good infosheet present on my e-mail with all necessary contacts, sights, shopping and more. High recommendations!"
663725,25123190,2016-05-09T01:39:41Z,"Grande et belle villa. Magnifique jardin. Nous nous sommes baignées dans ce décor magique.
Sergio est resté contact avec nous et nous répondait rapidement. 
La situation de la maison est parfaite.
J engage vivement à réserver cette maison."
663725,10054796,2016-05-01T02:21:44Z,"The villa was absolutely stunning - we had a fantastic time here with our two year old son.  Sergio was away when we arrived, but had arranged for us to be welcomed by Anna and Emanuela from Trulli and Dimore, whose communication prior to our arrival was excellent.  They met us in Monopoli and showed us the way to the villa.  The villa is beautifully designed, extremely spacious and private with everything you could need.  It was a little bit too cold to use the pool, but in Summer it would be perfect.  We enjoyed trips to Polignano, Monopoli, Alberobello, Locorotondo and Lecce.  Sergio kept in touch throughout our stay to make sure everything was ok, and met us on the day of departure.

One of our favourite Airbnb experiences to date and we look forward to returning."
663725,13596473,2016-04-17T13:40:22Z,"Sergio & Stefania have a true slice of heaven in this beautiful architecturally designed villa. 
It is spacious, bright & with the best sea views you could hope for. Our boys loved the infinity pool & the wonderful large garden. As if this wasn't enough, the best bit for me was the super comfortable Tempur mattresses ( I have a slipped disc). Sergio was in Rome but checked in every other day via email to make sure we had everything we needed. But he also has a management team who are available quite literally 24/7 & no request is too much. the property is about 12 mins to Polignano by car. But it's a lovely drive through olive groves & farm land. We were looking for a property to buy & Sergio's father in law was amazing! He took us to see some properties too. So generous & so welcoming. Thank you so very much Sergio & Stefania. We will definitely come back & stay in your gorgeous villa. Ciao & bacci bacci Suzanne & family xx"
663725,3785072,2016-04-05T09:49:11Z,"Sergio and Stefania's villa is perfect! I cannot imagine a better place to escape to. The thought and effort that has gone into creating the perfect get away is extraordinary. We loved the pool, the pizza oven and the recommendations for where to eat. I also loved that Sergio allowed me to communicate in Italian. Grazie mille per un soggiorno splendido!"
820227,112719723,2017-05-12T21:13:08Z,"The Airstream is a must visit to anyone that wants to escape to a simpler life.
Leave the chaos of the big cities and relax in a 360 panoramic of mountains sea and nature.
We saw 2 sunrises, 3 sunsets and a full moon rising over the mountains.
The back bone trail is a must and is only 2 miles hike up to a breathtaking view. A quick drive will take you to a gorgeous beach at Zuma or along the coast.
Malibu cafe is a must visit for lunch or dinner and paramount ranch for a western film set. We have to thank Murray for both of those tips.
Leave the curtains open near the table to get woken by a sunrise and relax. A place no one can forget.
The drive up to the Airstream is a dirt road but easily done by most drivers in most cars, don't worry about this bit as it's part of the experience."
820227,32281816,2017-05-09T15:16:50Z,"This Airbnb is a great escape ""off the grid"" and is equipped with all the necessities (e.g., towels, blankets, soap,   shampoo,pots, pans, utensils). Make sure to stop by a grocery store before you come up as it probably takes about a half hr to reach one when you're up there. It's all equipped with spices and olive oil (for your cooking needs!). Location is great- we spent the days hiking (and highly recommend the climb to Mugu Peak via the Chumash Trail- rugged but with it!) and the nights cooking, playing games, and star gazing.  The bed is VERY comfortable and we plan to return with more of our family!"
820227,9597089,2017-05-03T16:45:01Z,"Such a gem and unique experience to book an Airbnb with a retired Airstream Flying Cloud! 

Well worth the two night retreat. Peaceful and quite, off the grid, beautiful property views and friendly hosts!

We spent sunrises and sunsets in the airstream, making morning coffee and prepping meals for dinner. Took off during the heat of the day at Malibu beaches but always felt at home when we returned to the Flying Cloud. 

Our last morning before checking out we did the hike to the backbone trail and ""trickle"" waterfall. :)

What is really cool, is that when ever we dive down the 23 from now on, we can spot that cool Flying Cloud on the twisting road. :)

Thank you again Murray and Kay for the wonderful experience!"
820227,105767883,2017-05-01T18:15:40Z,My boyfriend and I had a kick ass time! thanks :)
820227,125925470,2017-04-29T21:09:01Z,"A perfect spot for a weekend getaway! Amazing views, isolated from people and oh, the stars... Spectacular! Murray stocks the place with all of the essentials. Just bring your favorite wine, nibbles and relax!"
820227,81730567,2017-04-26T21:53:43Z,"A unique experience that you will truly enjoy. The night star gazing was great but the sunrise was amazing. 

Murray is a great host and very welcoming to his property."
820227,122890486,2017-04-25T18:29:32Z,This is a very authentic rural experience. Perhaps more rustic than indicated by the photos. There is a steep drive up a dirt lane with sharp switchbacks to get to the site and the sleeping accommodations were not to our liking. Having said that the experience of the stars above Mailbu and the creaking of 1956 Airstream are unique and we are glad of the experience despite not wanting stay our second night. 
820227,105649146,2017-04-23T18:44:18Z,"This is a lovely couple's getaway for 1 to 2 nights where you are totally immersed in nature. We loved the views and being able to totally unplug. Murray was helpful, kind and hospitable. Highly recommend!"
820227,34379224,2017-04-19T16:44:32Z,"This place is insane! The most beautiful landscape I've ever seen. The peace, quite and tranquility of this location is second to none. It is the perfect place to switch off, detox and find yourself again in a world of Khaos. Will defiantly be back! 10/10! "
820227,24880145,2017-04-16T15:35:29Z,"This is an AMAZING location. The views are fabulous, and the trailer is really fun. It's compact (the toilet alongside the bed took a bit of getting used to), but had everything we needed and was a great base for exploring the area. Murray was very welcoming and an excellent host, as well as being knowledgeable about the local flora and fauna. Highly recommended!!!"
820227,10664519,2017-04-13T18:22:03Z,"I like camping, I don't love it.  Staying in a vintage Airstream is pretty much the only way you're going to get me to sleep 'outdoors'. And sleep I did! and dream, and hike and think and stretch... The road up the hill is an adventure in itself... my car made it ok, but i can imagine after a good rain it would be sketchy. I must say though, the view at the top is SO worth it.  

The trailer is definitely vintage, it's not new or fancy. It IS however perfectly suited to host one or two folks for a beautiful getaway from it all.  The amenities were just right, the bathroom is very tiny, fyi, but clean and worked great.

Murray and Kay were easy to get a hold of and a pleasure to chat with... as was Max their big black dog!! I'd stay again in a heartbeat!

"
820227,12759653,2017-04-11T15:31:26Z,"Staying at Murray's & Kay's was the perfect digital detox! With 360 degrees outstanding views of the ocean and mountains, this is truly a one of a kind experience and a glorious commune with nature!"
820227,25104533,2017-04-09T17:50:45Z,Great views and great location.  
820227,84101599,2017-04-08T16:41:29Z,A great getaway for a romantic stay. Totally off the grid and we loved every moment. 
820227,27700172,2017-04-02T16:25:46Z,"The weekend here was magical. I was excited to visit with my boyfriend after reading all the great reviews and looking at the pictures but you really have to experience it to feel the magic that this place brings. The sunsets, the star gazing, and the peacefulness of the property make it so easy to be present and enjoy the moment. Thank you Murray & Kay for sharing your property. I feel very fortunate to have been able to enjoy such a magical place. We made such special quality memories. I can't stop raving about your Airstream and property to my friends and family! 

We really appreciated the details: The Backbone hike recommendation, the flannel blankets for the chilly evenings, the insect repellent (a must once the sun starts setting), the books, games, the variety of lounging options outside, and everything included in the Airstream that made us feel at home and taken care of.  Kaitlan was a lovely host. "
820227,111053603,2017-03-31T17:22:54Z,"The Airstream was fantastic. The views are indescribable. Perfectly private and secluded. Best vacation spot in Malibu by far...
Will definitely be back for another stay"
820227,501605,2017-03-29T16:14:44Z,"We had a wonderful, peaceful and energizing time staying at Murray and Kay's Airstream. Their setup provides ample supplies for bathroom, sleeping and kitchen necessities. We wanted to brew our own coffee and they even had a kettle and French press to assist! 

If you love California sunrises, sunsets and the opportunity to star gaze at night with warm wool blankets provided, we would definitely recommend this Airstream experience. 

Keep in mind your amongst nature, so the occasional insect may drop in and say hello but that does not even outweigh the overall amazing experience you'll have staying here. "
820227,119929188,2017-03-27T18:00:13Z,"I booked this getaway for my husband and I for his birthday. The views are incredible and Murray and Kay were great in making sure we had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable! The views are incredible and the privacy is amazing. Unfortunately, you cannot avoid the motorcyclists and helicopters enjoying the Malibu area as well but it didn't bother us too much. Stargazing was amazing and Murray and Kay provided some very nice warm blankets. 

My only issue was that I did not know exactly what to pack for our stay and I feel like people should have an idea on what they should bring. For example, they have a great fridge and stove so packing food items such as: frozen food that can be cooked in the oven, wine/beer, cold cuts/sandwich buns, ground coffee (they have a french press). Also, the location of the trailer is really close to some good hiking trails and El Matador State Beach (15 minutes away). So I recommend some good hiking shoes and maybe a bathing suit/towel if you wanted to visit the beautiful beach. 

Also, I packed towels because the details on the page didn't seem to include it but in the end, Murray and Kay did provide towels. It's just one less thing to pack. 

It gets really dark at night so I would recommend bringing a headlight or flash light. They provided a flashlight but the batteries were dead. I'm sure we could have asked Murray to bring us some batteries but it was late and we didn't want to disturb them.

Lastly, just make sure you pack warm clothes for the evening! It gets chilly up there. 

The bed was surprisingly EXTREMELY comfortable! WOW! Like sleeping on a cloud. My husband and I struggle to sleep side by side in small beds and this was amazing! 

Beautiful stay overall, I loved Murray's property and all the gorgeous animals he has rescued. His horses are stunning and friendly! I hope my tips help the next guest(s) who stay there! 

Thank you again! "
820227,58161121,2017-03-25T15:31:05Z,The view from the Airstream truly has to be seen to be fully appreciated- this really is an experience to cherish forever. Murray and Kay were the perfect hosts and full of suggestions on local areas of interest. We'd recommend the hosts and venue to anyone.
820227,5425333,2017-03-20T16:33:14Z,This place is amazing - it knocked our socks off!! We were looking to unplug from the daily hustle and bustle of city life and the Malibu vintage airstream was just what we needed. The secluded location in the hills is perfection and the 360 view from the airstream is breathtaking. Murray was very welcoming and ensured the airstream was fully stocked for us. We can't wait to go back!

Thanks so much"
11533218,13756714,2017-04-05T12:17:23Z,"I had a great stay at Alper's condo. He was very accessible and helpful with messages. Accommodated my need to park in the morning and stay later if I needed. The place was very clean, lovely features, and cozy. And the view was beautiful! I highly recommend staying here for business professionals, or one or two couples wanting to see the city. "
11533218,43676452,2017-04-03T14:10:13Z,A great place close to the downtown.  Alper was also great to deal with.

11533218,86685856,2017-03-11T15:31:54Z,"Alper met us on arrival - very helpful and friendly.  Showed us everything we needed to know and was always available throughout the trip in case we needed assistance.  

The apartment is in a quiet location but with great restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk.  Uber's never took more than 3 minutes to pull up when called, so all very easy.

The pool was a welcome luxury - always a great way to get over jet lag.

Worth noting that you can no longer leave baggage at Union Station unless you are travelling on the VIA service, so if your flight home isn't until the evening you should consider booking an extra night with Alper.

Thanks for a great trip!"
